Welcome to Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay Marvellous things
await you One of your group will control an entire world, while
the rest of you will live in and explore it, uncovering glittering
wonders, vile darkness, and everything in between
You’ll meet glorious heroes who grimace disdainfully as they
step over the suffering poor, and corrupt villains who set down
the wrong path in the service of a more laudable cause Feared
but respected wizards master their arts in the high towers of the
Colleges of Magic, while outside those safe halls magic users are
feared and reviled — and often with good cause, as many dark
sorcerers would gladly sell their souls for power Virtuous priests
strive endlessly to improve the lives of the downtrodden, whilst
agents of Chaos Gods work to undermine this good work and
bring ruination
Prepare yourself for the struggle of the gutter, to fight for your
survival, and to face corruption on all sides Prepare yourself for
danger, as it is everywhere, and you can’t face it alone And, most
of all, prepare yourself for the grim and perilous adventure of
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay!
Roleplaying Games
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP) is a tabletop roleplaying
game (RPG) You might be more familiar with computer
or console RPGs, in which case you’ll be right at home One
of your group will take the role of Gamemaster (GM) — who
describes the world and what is happening — and everyone else
will be a Player — one of the game’s protagonists, interacting
with the world the GM presents Players tell the GM what their
I

‘So, what are you here for? Adventure?
 Maybe Gold? Probably Justice?
Ha, that’s a flexible term! What’s that I see in your eye, that pious gleam? Oh, you want
to do the right thing So long as it’s well enough paid, entertaining, and fits with your
political views Eh, close enough, you’ll do, come inside and I’ll tell you about the job’

Games of WFRP use ten-sided dice whenever a random result is
required Ten-sided dice are typically marked from 0–9, where a
roll of 0 counts as a result of 10 These dice are called d10s in
the rules, and the number you need to roll will always be marked
as follows: 1d10 for 1 die, 2d10 for two dice, 3d10 for three dice,
and so on
If you are requested to roll multiple dice like this, the results are
always added together So, if the rules ask you to roll 2d10, you roll
two ten-sided dice and add the result of each together; for example:
a roll of 0 and 3 would be a result of 13 (10+3=13)
Sometimes, a die roll will be modified by adding or subtracting a
number So, a roll of 1d10+4 means roll one ten-sided die and add
four to the result, and a roll of 2d10-3 indicates you should roll 2
ten-sided dice and subtract 3 from the totalled result
The rules also use a roll of two ten-sided dice to score a number
from 1 to 100 (marked as 1d100) To do this, one ten-sided die is
designated as a ‘tens’ die, and the other as the ‘units’ die Now roll
the two dice, and read the result as a two-digit number So a roll of
1 on the tens die and 4 on the units die provides a result of 14, or a
roll of 4 and 2 results with 42 If both dice roll 0, the result is 100
Throwing Bones
Characters are doing, and the GM interprets the outcomes of
those actions, using the game’s rules where necessary The game
proceeds in that fashion, with the Players pursuing the plot the
GM has prepared for the game, or perhaps going off at wild
tangents as the poor GM improvises like crazy It’s all good
This book is the rulebook and includes all the information and
options for running your games of WFRP If you’ve never played
an RPG before, we’d recommend you try the Warhammer
Fantasy Roleplay Starter Set — which is designed to teach you
how to play — or take a look at the ‘What is an RPG?’ section of
our website: wwwcubicle7couk
Using This Book
Roughly speaking, the Player-focused parts of this book are to
the front New players should start by browsing the double-page
spreads and letter that introduce the Empire as this is where the
initial adventures that Cubicle 7 publishes will be set
Players should then use the next few chapters to learn about their
Characters and abilities Chapter 5, the Rules, are for everyone
Players whose characters have a religious or magical background
will want to be familiar with the respective sections later in the
book The GM can communicate to the Players as much or as little
of the Reikland and Bestiary chapters as they should appropriately
know, but remember not to give away too many spoilers
Game Text
To help keep the rules clear, this book adopts some standard ways
of presenting information:
Game Terms: All game terms are capitalised, so you can tell
events from Events, and know when a test should be simple and
when you should make a Simple Test
Individual Items: Some game terms encompass many individual
items For example: the game term Spells includes many
individual spells a wizard can cast Each individual item will be
italicised Example: a Banking Endeavour; a Bleeding Condition;
the Curse Spell
Tests: When you are asked to make a Test (see page 149), it will
be bolded so you can find it easily during play Example: make an
Average (+20) Perception Test
Acronyms: The rulebook avoids them as much as possible, but
it’s important in roleplaying games (RPGs) like Warhammer
Fantasy Roleplay (WFRP — we pronounce it WuffRupp)
to explain your acronyms the first time the word is used The
Gamemaster (GM) who runs the game can usually clear up any
confusion
Advice: Our Characters are on hand in box-outs throughout
the book to offer advice and options Each discusses different
elements of the game If you want to know more about the
Characters, refer to the WFRP Starter Set
Your Warhammer

phenomenon over 30 years in the making, and we all have our
own take on this rich and vibrant setting That’s something we
really want to celebrate, and we want your adventures to take
place in your version of Warhammer
Throughout the book we present as many options as we can so
that you can tailor the game to your vision, many of which are

Introduction I
The borders of the Glorious Empire of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I are the impenetrable plate armour
He has erected to protect His people The Empire extends to the seas, or until the land ceases to be of worth, such
as the wasteland stubbornly clung to by those fools in Marienburg The Bountiful Empire of His Imperial Majesty Emperor
Karl-Franz I is of course the envy of all those who survey it, turning all eyes to covetousness But fear not, for His Imperial
Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I is resolute in our defence, with unbreachable fortresses full of indefatigable soldiers at every
mountain pass, river bridge, and other such strategic locations 
The Empire is beset by enemies to all sides, and the defence of its borders is often compromised by the
politicking nobles, from lowly barons to the Elector Counts who rule them Fortunately, mountain ranges and
coastlines form a natural barrier along much of the Empire’s borders, all of which provide natural lines of
defence Guard duty overlooking a potential invasion route is often a lonely, mind-numbingly dull affair; and,
when it’s not, chances are the garrison will be overrun long before the alarm is raised 
Many claim the Court of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I is the heart of the Empire The Emperor
Himself would strike such lickspittles and point out with wisdom and deep humility that it is instead the countless
villages of His mighty Empire that supply His limitless strength For it is there His people nobly toil to provide food for
all, to produce goods and raw materials for trade, and raise doughty warriors for the glorious State Armies that protect us
It is a simple life, satisfyingly full of blessed toil, which is its own reward In many ways, we desk-bound scholars, while
unswerving in our duty to His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I, are truly envious of life in this rural paradise
Far from the courts, peasants tirelessly work the land, much as they have for longer than any can
remember The village boundary is, for most, the end of their world Some might travel to neighbouring
settlements, but such journeys are viewed with trepidation This can lead to xenophobia, which is often
acutely felt towards nearby settlements, probably due to historic conflict over local resources; so, while a
visitor from Altdorf may be treated with suspicion, villagers reserve their real hatred for that wretch
from the hamlet a few miles yonder who stole their grandfather’s chicken
By the light of day, villagers may scoff at old tales of monsters, beasts, and daemons, believing in the
power of their lords and gods to protect them But as the sun sets over the forest and fields, all lock
their doors securely and, in flickering candlelight, exchange nervous glances at any unexpected sound
I
t is said the mighty rivers bear the lifeblood of the Resplendent Empire of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I,
flowing from the mineral-laden mountains to bring wealth and prosperity for all The masters of robust riverboats and
barges keep a lucrative flow of goods moving from the furthest reaches of the Empire of His Imperial Majesty Emperor
Karl-Franz I to the bustling cities and ports, bringing riches beyond compare This is all made possible by the eternal
vigilance and unstinting protection offered by His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I’s Imperial Navy and Imperial
River Patrol, who efficiently guard all of His river-borne citizens allowing them to concentrate on their admirable hard work
without pause for fear or doubt
If the rivers bear the Empire’s lifeblood, the arteries and veins they flow through are in dangerously
poor condition The Imperial Navy patrols the wide flows of the primary rivers, and Riverwardens
theoretically keep watch everywhere else, but minor waterways can go months without seeing a hint of the
Emperor’s protection As a result, wreckers and pirates can be found anywhere outside the immediate
scrutiny of the authorities, and as the rivers wind through the forest depths, who knows what cruel or
unnatural creatures wait to ambush passing vessels When travelling lesser trafficked stretches, wise
folk should be obviously armed and clearly ready for a fight in the hope of persuading those with ill
intent to allow them to pass in favour of easier pickings 
The docks of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I’s ports are engineering marvels established to profit from
His shrewd trade policies and diplomatic brilliance Dealing firmly and authoritatively with lesser realms, yet always
with magnanimity, His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I has ensured our extraordinary prosperity through lucrative
treaties with a range of diverse peoples including the fading power of the Elves from across the sea, the barbaric Kislevites
to the east, and the short-sighted Wastelanders who cannot survive without the food we generously provide But these fade
into inconsequentiality when compared to the profound alliance His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I unstintingly
maintains with the redoubtable Dwarfs of the mountains, a wise accord that has stood since it was initiated by Holy Sigmar
Himself, First Emperor and God-King of us all!
The docks are indeed a major centre of the Empire’s power and prosperity, although the reliance on the
trade they bring is often downplayed in courtly circles While this is certainly due in part to the nobility’s
disdain for commerce, it also goes against an instinct for stubborn self-reliance and a belief in their
ongoing ascendency In reality, other realms extend their power into the Empire’s ports, and none more so
than the Wasteland Marienburg merchant houses have significantly more influence over trade than any
Reiklander will admit, and heavily armed Wastelander vessels often accompany their goods barges into
the Empire This is ostensibly to protect against piracy, but in practice it guards against an ‘accidental’
attack by the Imperial Navy, and also openly demonstrates the growing confidence and military might of
the Wasteland 
The powerful and awe-inspiring towns and cities of the prosperous Empire are the crown jewels of His Imperial Majesty
Emperor Karl-Franz I’s realm Rich, cultured, pious, educated, and thriving, their extraordinary planning and aweinspiring
architecture are the envy of all, and bring wide-eyed travellers from across the world to witness their magnificence
Under the nurturing rule of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I, each of His multitudinous subjects have
opportunities to better themselves and rise to lofty new stations Even the simple folk of the Empire, despite their lowly and
often distasteful appearance, are industrious and optimistic, always seeking new opportunities for the betterment of all
The major settlements of the Empire may feature some of the most impressive architecture, glorious
palaces, and inspirational temples, but these are all surrounded by disgusting filth and squalor,
staggering inequality, and incredible levels of crime and disorder The upper classes are frequently drunk
on the power they wield, or corrupted by something much worse, and so the possibility of positive change
and improvement in conditions is negligible This leads to social disorder, agitators brewing discontent,
and all-too-many desperate people with little to lose
The simple, yet glorious inns of His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I’s Empire are part of what binds His loyal
people together His Imperial Majesty Emperor Karl-Franz I Himself is said to frequent them in cunning disguises in
order to share in the jolly camaraderie and simple pleasures of the thankful common folk, whilst graciously not over-awing
these good, honest people with His astonishing Imperial Magnificence The Empire’s finest fare can be found in these
palaces of the people, and your humble scribe heartily recommends pickled trotter as a digestive aid
Inns and taverns are a distraction from the misery of existence for many citizens of the Empire, and
an entertaining diversion for many more They can often be places where political agitators do their work
to whip up sentiment against the authorities, or where witch hunters prowl for rumours of the unnatural
Con artists and robbers also ply their trade amongst the inebriated unwary, although there is also some
honest respite to be had, and the scribe is right about the pickled trotter 
c/o Colonel Reikhardt Mathis Sievers of the Imperial Ostlanders
Wolfenburg’s 2nd Regiment of Foot
Stationed in Khypris
The Border Princes
32nd Sigmarz eit, 2511 I C
My Lord Konrad von Siert, Baron of Siert and Castellan of Ostergrootsch,
Greetings and salutations,
Herein find a summons and general information concerning the Empire, your homeland
I am instructed to inform you that your lord and father, Duke Ottokar von Siert, officially recognises your claim to inherit his land
and titles within the Reikland, and orders you to his side Your exile in the Border Princes is at an end, and you must make immediate
preparations for departure
In his wisdom, your father has employed an armed escort to assist I am in command, and, Sigmar willing, will arrive sometime near
Sonnestill You will leave with us for the Imperial capital the following morning Surely, such news will fill your young heart with joy, for
you will finally witness the splendour of the greatest city in the Old World: Altdorf the magnificent, seat of Emperor Karl-Franz I
and the Grand Theogonist of Sigmar, and current residence of House Siert, where your father holds court not far from the Imperial Zoo
on Goellner Hill
I shall also take your education in hand Those advising your father believe the present tuition you receive from Colonel Sievers, whilst
certainly admirable, is too focussed on southern matters as epitomised by Holy Myrmidia - a goddess without reproach when it comes to
the military, I’m sure, but hardly an expert concerning Reiklander rulership It was decided by your father’s advisors that a true devotee
of Sigmar - the Empire’s patron deity - should promptly take charge of your education Your father, of course, agreed, for the Cult of
Sigmar should always be heeded
Sadly, I must report poor Sister Bartalin, the nun assigned to this important duty, passed through Morr’s Portal when our party was
but five days from Altdorf She was the victim of a most unfortunate accident involving a bedpan, a wilted stick of celery, and a nasty
fall Thus, I humbly take her stead For, no matter my feelings on the subject, your schooling is imperative; you have yet to set foot in the
Empire, and you will be lost without proper instruction
Before we begin, let us turn to introductions: I am Magister Alanna Graumann of the Grey Order - and let me pre-empt your
assumptions: yes, I am a witch; and, yes, my name is a pseudonym I have been in the service of your father for over fifteen years, acting as
an aide, military advisor, and bodyguard, amongst other things, and am now charged to ensure you, his newly declared heir, reach Altdorf
alive To guarantee this I will, as mentioned, attend to your education, which will start immediately
Forget What You Know
There are several matters I would have you consider before I arrive in Khypris You likely think life in the
Empire will be much the same as the sunny lifestyle you currently enjoy in the Border Princes - after all, there
are the same eight days in the week, the same sun and moons, and the same gods I regret to inform you such
presumptions are incorrect: the Empire is not like the Border Princes, and you are ill-prepared for the threats it
hides Put plainly: you are not safe, and most of what you think you know will lead you to danger






 









The Gods
As you know, throughout the Old World folk freely worship many different gods, most commonly those directly impacting their daily
lives So, if someone is hurt, one prays to Shallya, Goddess of Healing and Mercy; when a hunt fails, one prays to Taal, God of Animals
and Wild Places; and if crops should wither, one turns to Rhya, Goddess of Life and Fertility
But in your homeland, one god rises head and shoulders above the others: Sigmar, who founded the Empire when mortal, and now stands
as its patron deity In the grand province where your lands lie, the Reikland, the Cult of Sigmar dominates: every village has a temple,
every town has several, and the capital, Altdorf, has more holy sites dedicated to Sigmar than any bother to count Each Festag (what the
locals call the last day of the week - the one you call ‘Holiday’), all are expected to attend ‘throng’ at a local temple, where Sigmar’s priests
preach lessons concerning the founder of the Empire, he who wielded the Warhammer Further, many temples require all able-bodied folk
to train at arms weekly with the local priests or their representatives, forming the core of local militias to support the State Armies In
larger towns and cities, it is only the faithful and the lost that attend these weekly duties, but in rural areas, any not attending are viewed
with deep suspicion Trust me, my lord, this is a cult you will need to understand, for most folk of the Reikland are ingrained with its
customs, and you must appear to be, also You may think you understand Sigmar because there is a shrine in Khypris You do not
Witches
One cannot talk of Sigmar without also discussing witches - those able to use magic Obviously, it’s a subject close to my heart, although
I prefer to be called a Magister, as I am trained by the Colleges of Magic The folk of the Empire, like all peoples of the Old World, are
solid and practical, and quick to remove dangerous elements from their communities Given the Cult of Sigmar preaches that Sigmar was
tempted and betrayed by evil witches, it will come as no surprise that in areas of strong Sigmar worship, witches are not just viewed with
suspicion, they are vilified Fortunately, the talent for witchery is very rare, but for those born with it any unexpected manifestation of their
arcane powers may see them burned at the stake, even if Imperial Law states they should be taken to the Colleges of Magic
The Colleges of Magic
There is no formal centre of magical learning in the Border Princes Those able to do magic either work it out independently, accidentally
kill themselves, are hunted down, or find a master to teach them Most such masters practice ancient forms of magic that are certainly
dangerous, ranging from supposedly benign hedge witches and seers to those who risk their very souls, including power-blinded fools like
necromancers and daemonologists In the Empire, it’s very different To practice any magic you must have a licence, and the only way to
secure one is to be a graduated Magister of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf, or be an Elf -they receive special dispensation for their part in
founding the Colleges - assuming they register with the Colleges, of course If you have no licence and cast magic, you are breaking the law and
should be either taken to the Colleges for proper training or tried as a criminal Most commonly, illegal witches are tried by mob and lynched
Which, to be clear, is also illegal, although few are punished for this crime as most would prefer to see a witch dead, regardless of the legality
While murdering suspected witches may sound extreme to your ears, there are good reasons for caution: all witches channel the Winds of
Magic, invisible flows of power that course across the world, and many claim these Winds originate from the Ruinous Powers
The Ruinous Powers
The less I speak of this the better, and might I suggest you never speak of it There is always something listening At its simplest, whatever
your current tutors pretend, the dark gods do exist They whisper of the ruination of all things, and too many fools listen But do the
Winds of Magic blow from the Ruinous Powers, turning good folk into witches, and twisting minds and flesh in their wake ? That’s
not a question I think I can answer What I can say is that the dark gods’ influence is felt at all levels of society, and those drawing too
close are always changed by what they encounter This is why folk are terrified of mutation: they believe it is a mark of damnation, a sign
the dark gods now hold your soul Even talking in the most general terms about such subjects may well bring you to the attention of the
witch hunters, so remain wary for signs of this dark corruption but do not betray that you are even aware of its existence







 






The Powers That Be
‘In the Borderlands, all may come to power, and all may come to rule! In the Empire, we willingly wrap ourselves in chains!’
Those were the ardent words of a young, idealistic agitator I met in Wissenburg Consider what she says, for you will soon encounter those
who believe it true In the Empire, you are born to a station, and no amount of cleverness or capability will change what the gods plan, or
so those in power repeatedly claim If you are born noble, you are forever noble; born farming, forever farming And so it remains But as
you personally know, my lord, the chance offerings of birth can be changed and manipulated by forces far from divine And even in the
Empire, new freedoms are being bought every day
The Cities and Towns
For all the stratified layers of society are supposedly immutable, the flourishing towns and cities of the Empire, safely wrapped with high
walls of stone and patrolled by liveried State Soldiers, have allowed a new class of rich merchants and burghers to rise The Reikland, as
the richest of all the Empire’s grand provinces, has a growing ‘middle’ class of such enormity it frequently rises to prominence, with rich
individuals buying their way to freedom and power An example of this are towns called ‘Freiburgs’ or ‘free towns’, meaning they selfgovern
without significant interference from the nobility in return for services, military support, or, most commonly, large quantities of coin
Although the concept of a Freiburg is old, never have so many been seen in such a small area as increasingly more towns are buying their
freedom; although all this seemingly changes nothing for those toiling in the fields
Rural Life
Where the towns and cities are becoming freer, it could be argued the opposite is the case for many rural communities Over two hundred
years ago, Emperor Magnus the Pious famously enshrined the rights of all to be paid for their labour, but many noble houses did not agree
with this attack on their rights and continue to resist to this day
Enlightened provinces such as the lands ruled by your father, where farmers work land they lease, selling any produce they harvest at local
markets for personal profit, paying taxes as determined by the local authorities, are widespread But in some isolated regions the peasantry
are forced to slave on farms they do not own, turning over almost all produce to their lieges, living in total ignorance of the freedoms the
Imperial Law grants them Many folk will put up with a lot so long as horns echo across the land each campaign season as noble lords
send the State Army to rid the encroaching forest of whatever foulness has gathered
And it is there one of the greatest differences between your current home in Khypris and Sigmar’s Holy Empire lies: the endless forests
The Empire is blanketed in dense woodlands, and few dare venture into their depths, for their twisted branches hide far worse than simple
bandits, beastmen, and forest goblins
Travel
Bisecting the Border Princes, the Khyprian Road is famous for its relative safety Its entire six-hundred mile length is cleared on both
sides for many miles, ensuring would-be bandits have few places to hide The opposite circumstances apply in the Empire Almost all the
major roads cut through thick forests with uncounted ambush points, leaving travel by foot extraordinarily dangerous Thus, wealthy
folk travel by river as most major towns are connected by river or canal, and the major waterways of the Empire are often so wide you can
barely see the opposite banks - let alone any potential wreckers hiding in the rushes - making them significantly safer than tree-lined
highways where bandits lurk around every corner
Of course, sometimes a road journey is the only option, especially when one is travelling to one of the many highland fortifications or mining
towns In such circumstances, I recommend you travel by coach These not only provide comfortable travelling conditions between all major
destinations, but their routes are patrolled by road wardens, making them relatively safe The Empire is also significantly more civilised
than the Border Princes, so boasts many reliable coaching houses












 






Patrols
Recognising the threat posed by highway pillagers, all the major roads of the Reikland are patrolled by mounted squads of road wardens
Most are peacetime State Army cavalrymen put to use by local nobles, but some are privately hired, often by merchant or coaching houses,
to better maintain the peace and protect expensive assets When travelling away from the primary trade routes, the roads are not so well
maintained, and some are lucky to ever see a road warden, so I suggest avoiding these dark corners of the Empire, for the local folk are often
all-too-quick to take offense, all your trappings, and perhaps even your life
The rivers are similarly patrolled, but by strong-backed riverwardens in a variety of different vessels ranging from small patrol boats to
small warships called Shipswords These wardens are supported by the Imperial Navy, which is, against all the expectations of outsiders,
based in the Reiksport at Altdorf, hundreds of miles upriver from the sea The navy’s large warships patrol the waters to Marienburg,
where the river Reik is often many miles wide, and very deep
The Law
The powers granted to wardens patrolling the rivers and roads, and to the watch patrolling the streets of the Empire’s towns and cities,
vary significantly from province to province Small infractions of the law normally result in stern words and spot fines, most of which
never leave the pocket of the lawman concerned In larger towns and cities, it is also common to find petty courts run by watch captains
who judge cases brought before them, handing out fines of a shilling or two for most misdeeds, with serious crimes referred to a higher
authority For such crimes, the accused is taken before a local court, most commonly officiated by a judge, noble, magistrate, or a cleric of the
Goddess of Justice, Verena These trials are rarely fair, so it is wise to never let matters proceed so far
As a lord of the Reikland, you cannot be tried by a normal court, so should you ever find yourself accused, do not be afraid to make
your birthright known Should I not be with you, send word to the Grey College and ask for me by name I will come To be sure you
understand, only your father, as your lord, has the right to judge you However, another noble may appeal against your father’s judgement;
should this occur, only the High Lord Steward of the Reikland has the right to overrule your father in matters of criminal law
But such almost never happens The High Lord Steward has not held court for over fifty years, for most nobles are too powerful to bring
to task Instead, deals are made, charges are dropped, and the problems disappear
Be Careful
So, given the many risks, I hope you can understand why your father sends an escort to ensure your safety Your inexperience with the
folk of the Empire could easily lead to disaster For all you may think a local watchman is there to help you, or a riverwarden seems a
helpful fellow, they may be as corrupt as the folk they are tasked to detain This is why I come Let my experience be your teacher, so you need
not learn from your own errors, which could prove fatal There is a reason I use a pseudonym, and why I feel it is important not to say
aught openly
There is, after all, hidden motivations behind all matters Even this letter
I look forward to seeing you when you understand Be careful
With faith,
A Grau ma n n

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
 Character 
Players explore the Old World through the eyes of their Character
This chapter shows you how to make your own Character from
scratch Most begin the game as unremarkable inhabitants of the
Empire — possibly destined for greatness, but no-one would guess
it That’s not to say you can’t rise from humble origins, just that
you’ve got a long journey ahead, and that you’ll probably need a
better pair of boots
All the information describing your Character’s abilities is
recorded on a Character Sheet (see page 344) We provide
ready-made Characters and sheets in the WFRP Starter Set,
and online at cubicle7couk Using ready-made Characters is
a great way to start playing and find out how the game works,
but sooner or later you’ll want to create your own from the
ground up If you are choosing a ready-made Character, it’s
still worth looking through this chapter, as it will explain what
the different parts of the Character Sheet mean (especially the
summary on page 44)
When deciding what your Character will be like, discuss the
kind of group you want to create with the other players This
makes sure that the group’s Characters complement each other
and that together you will have a broad and versatile range of
abilities Your GM may also have a particular kind of game
in mind, and you’ll need to make sure you have the right mix
of Characters Perhaps the GM plans for you to join a group
of apprentice wizards who know one another at the Colleges
of Magic? Maybe you are part of a unit of soldiers who have
all deserted? Or maybe you are one of a disparate band of
Reiklanders press-ganged into service by a powerful noble?
Knowing this is important to help you build a suitable character
which will be more fun to play
Creating a Character
The first thing you’ll need is a blank Character Sheet (see page
344 or the downloads section of cubicle7couk), or a scrap sheet
of paper Once you have that, you’ll follow nine steps to create
your character As you move through the nine steps, you’ll record
the information about your character as you go
In some sections, you can either choose an option or accept the
result of a dice roll to make the choice for you You may receive
bonus Experience Points (XP) for choosing to accept random
outcomes, as if the Dark Gods of Chaos themselves applaud
your acceptance of random chance XP represent learning
from experience and are the principal way to improve your
abilities — you will be able to spend these points to enhance
your character’s abilities XP are covered in more detail in

Humans (Reiklander)
Humans are the most numerous and widespread of the civilised
species of the Old World From the plains of the Estalian
Kingdoms to the frozen oblasts of Imperial Kislev, Humans
occupy every corner of the continent, and they thrive The
largest, most powerful Human realm is the Empire, a patchwork
of powerful provinces blanketed in seemingly endless forests
Standing proud at the heart of this Empire, the Reikland is its
richest, most cosmopolitan region
Many Reiklanders see it as their divine right to rule, for the
patron god of the Empire, Sigmar, was himself a Reiklander
before he ascended to godhood many centuries ago Temples
and shrines to the god are found everywhere, and the majority of
Reiklanders are devout believers in Sigmar’s message of Empire
and unity Because of this, they are significantly more friendly,
open, and optimistic than other folk, since what could possibly
go wrong for a land that birthed a god? By comparison, outsiders
often see them as arrogant, over-bearing meddlers who stick their
unwanted noses into any affair
Beyond their affluent lifestyles and pushy personalities,
Reiklanders are largely the same as other Humans They may
be shorter-lived than other species, but Humans possess more
vigour, versatility, and ambition They also have a seemingly
inextricable relationship with the insidious horrors of the Ruinous
Powers, with more Humans falling to corruption than any other
species Perhaps it’s no surprise the declining elder species grow
increasingly concerned the meteoric rise of Humanity could
result in cataclysm
Opinions
On Dwarfs…
‘They’ve been our allies since Sigmar walked this very city;
fought with them meself back in ’05 Sure, they’re a bit stubborn,
seriously vindictive and pretty blunt, but I won’t hear a word said
against them’
– Reikäger Jungling, State Soldier from Altdorf
On Halflings…
‘If I gets meself the sort wot eats and smokes all day, then I’m
happy as Ranald in catnip It’s when I get them without proper
manners nicking me crockery or knives and forks: that I just can’t
abide! They’re all smiles and shrugs when the watch come to pick
’em up, like they don’t understand what they done wrong’
– Stefan Krause, Innkeeper from Stirgau
On High Elves…
‘Yes, I do trade with them And, no, don’t be ridiculous, I’ve never
been turned to a pillar of salt just by looking at them Truly, I find
them graceful and urbane Proper civilised, I’d say But, ’tween you
and me, if Verena were to ask, I might also say I find them just…
odd So very intense Like every deal we make really matters’
– Dorothea Taalenstein, Merchant from Kemperbad
On Wood Elves…
‘Elves of the forest you say? Ain’t none of ’em around here, mate
You want to be goin’ south to Bretonnia I hear they gots loads of
them, and that they’re completely horrible!’
– Siggina Gerster, Bawd from Ubersreik
Dwarfs
Dwarfs — or ‘Dawi’ as they call themselves — are legendarily gruff
and stubborn While the majority reside in vast mountainside
fortresses known as Holds, most larger towns and the capital of
the Reikland also have Dwarf populations Given their clannish
nature, they tend to band together, forming enclaves or districts
wherever they settle Many of the Dwarfs living in Reikland
are the descendants of those driven from Fallen Holds many
centuries ago, but most still consider themselves as Dwarfs of the
Grey Mountains, although some have never seen a hill, let alone
a mountain
Dwarf culture respects skill in crafting — chiefly stonework,
smithing and engineering — and Dwarf Holds are resplendent
with impressive feats of artifice They also covet gold and jewels,
mining deep beneath the mountains in the pursuit of precious
metals and gemstones However, more than these material
possessions, Dwarfs venerate their elders and ancestors, and have
entire religions focussing upon important progenitors Dwarfs
cannot cast spells, although their runesmiths carve artefacts with
intricate runes to harness magical power
Character II
25
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
However, their prowess as engineers is so impressive that some
of their more ingenious clockwork or steam-powered devices are
mistaken for magic by simpler folk
Dwarfs are squat with thick, muscular limbs and stout, broad
torsos Their features are heavy and their hair is thick Length of
hair is a mark of pride and status amongst Dwarfs, with elaborate
braids and adornments demonstrating rank: to shave a Dwarf
causes terrible shame Indeed, honour is a fundamental aspect of
their character Given their long memories and proud natures, they
bear grudges against those who have slighted or dishonoured them,
gripping tight to their grievances for many years, even taking on
the grudges borne by their ancestors, knowing their forebears will
be watching over them, nursing their bitterness long after death
Whilst it might be hard for others to win a Dwarf ’s friendship,
once given it is absolute While not as ageless as the near-immortal
Elves, Dwarfs can live for many centuries Indeed, some say that as
long as a Dwarf has a purpose, they will not die unless struck down
in battle, such is the strength of their conviction
Opinions
On Reiklander Humans…
‘Like my father and my father afore me, I’ve been living in
Reikland all me life As folk go, they know not to mess with
my business, and show the respect I deserve, as is right Yes,
they’re unreliable, and as changeable as the wind, but they’re also
resourceful and shrewd, so I’d recommend them as risky business
partners, as they see solutions I’d not even consider’
– Garral Herraksson, Jeweller from Eilhart
On Halflings…
‘They’re just not my kind of folk Always smiling Always
fidgeting Always talking Always moving in big groups that
just won’t shut up! When they come in my store, I like to shoo
them off with a broom Really, what have they got to be so happy
about? I just don’t trust them’
– Helgi Galannasniz, Burgher from Schrabwald
On High Elves…
‘Don’t talk to me about those bloody bastards! Alrug Skycaster,
my ultimate granduncle, was bloody betrayed in the bloody
War of bloody Vengeance by those… those… ARGH! It’s our
clan’s oldest grudge! Stood for thousands of bloody years! When
I find the descendants of bloody Galanthiel Whisperthorn, by
Grungni! I’m going to teach them all — every single last one of
them — a lesson in manners with my axe!’
– Snorrt Leivvusson, Diplomat from Karak Ziflin
On Wood Elves…
‘My great grandfather thought logging forests on t’other side of
the Grey Mountains would be lucrative Ignored all the warnings,
he was sure he was onto a winner What could a bunch of skinny
Elves do to him and his lads, after all? A lot, as it turned out Only
my grandfather survived, left alive to spread the message: “Keep
away” So, me and my lads are preparing a party to take revenge’
– Merig Ranvigsdottir, Villager from Azorn-Kalaki
Options: Animosity (Elves)
Given the long memories of Dwarfs and their tendency to
bear grudges, many harbour a deep resentment towards Elves
for their part in the War of Vengeance As such, many Dwarfs
have the Animosity (Elves) Psychology trait (see page 190)
Given some WFRP parties contain both Elves and Dwarfs,
this may lead to unhelpful tensions So, you may prefer to
ignore this Talent between party members
Halflings
Halflings are ubiquitous across the Reikland, found working
in service industries in all towns, with an entire district of
Reikland’s capital of Altdorf, known as Haffenstadt, packed
tight with hundreds of extended Halfling families supporting
restaurants, taverns, pipeweed stores, and an enormous number
of street-food hawkers Halflings are also a common sight
in many of Reikland’s villages, where it is not uncommon to
find them employed to staff an inn or run a farm They are
communal creatures, preferring to live in close-knit family
groups, sharing houses, rooms,and even beds with dozens of
26
II
friends and relatives; everyone contributes and everyone shares
This interdependent lifestyle leaves many Halflings struggling with
the concept of private ownership and space
Halflings are notoriously interested in recording their lineage,
and many Halfling clans can trace their ancestry back many
centuries to the very founding of the Mootland (their selfgoverned
Grand Province in the Empire) The Elder of the
Moot — currently Hisme Stoutheart — is the custodian of the
Haffenlyver, an ancient embroidered scroll detailing the chief
bloodlines of their primary clans, said to be the greatest treasure
of the Halflings
Another peculiar detail is the Halflings’ strange affinity for
Ogres Despite their ravenous appetites, and penchant for eating
whatever is at hand, Ogres tend to respect Halflings Indeed,
gangs of Ogre labourers are often overseen by Halfling gaffers,
and most Ogre mercenary bands have a Halfling cook on staff
Halflings are short, apple-cheeked and beardless, resembling
big-eyed, round-faced (and round bodied) Human children,
and their sunny dispositions and curly locks only reinforce this
impression They are known for their enormous appetites in
all things and their lack of concern for personal space (they’re
huggers), social boundaries (‘Well me’ great aunt’s just shacked
up with me best mate, and you should hear what they’ve been
up to!’), and property rights (‘It’s not like he’s using it!’); this last
has landed more than one Halfling in jail for thievery
Opinions
On Reiklander Humans…
‘Stiff-necked and pious, warlike and jealous… I could go on, but
good manners halts me, and, besides, I like them, and they like
me pies As long as you keep away from their temples and the
hard-liners, they’re an open and pretty welcoming bunch Good
folk, and good for business’
– ‘Tubs’ Samworth Rumster XVI, Pie-seller from Kalegan
On Dwarfs…
‘My aunt Bessi was the greediest, as were six of her sons But Bessi
has nothing on them Dwarfs Eyes grow as big as Mannslieb at
even a scratch of gold But, if you tell them that, they’ll growl
at you like you’ve taken the last honeycake, and start scribbling
notes in one of their damned books about insulting their family
honour or whatnot’
– ‘Lilly’ Joseppinalina Hayfoot, Pedlar in the Reikland
On High Elves…
‘I’ve seen them on the rivers in their white ships How do they
keep them so clean? And their hair… oh, their hair… it’s like
sunshine, it is Snuck on a boat once to see what they do Same as
the rest of us, it seems, just more earnestly’
– ‘Dainty’ Cordelineth Brandysnap IV, Thief from Altdorf
On Wood Elves…
‘Elves living in the woods? Don’t be bloody ridiculous Elves live
in white towers and pretty boats over in Altdorf-town, you idiot’
– ‘Jammy’ Mercimaus Alderflower II, Scholar from Fielbach
High Elves
High Elves are a relatively common sight on the rivers of Reikland
Both Altdorf and Nuln boast sizeable districts populated by High
Elf merchants who ship goods down the Reik through Marienburg
to the sea These merchants are by far the most numerous of the
High Elves found in Reikland, alongside diplomatic entourages
and support staff Aloof, alien, and long-lived, they are a passionate,
emotional folk widely perceived in the Reikland to be the most
beautiful of the species, and also the most arrogant
Tall and slender with delicately pointed ears, most Elves have
long, fine hair and melodious voices Although they might look
frail, their physiology is not only surprisingly strong, but also
extraordinarily agile and dextrous There are very few noticeable
gender differences between Elves, which often causes confusion
among Humans who interact with them
The High Elves, who call themselves ‘Asur’, are native to
Ulthuan, a magical island lying to the west of the Old World
A proud species, they boast of being amongst the oldest of the
world’s civilisations High Elves show considerable disdain for
Dwarfs, with whom they have a long history of conflict Since
their abandonment of the Old World in the aftermath of the
War of the Beard, the Asur have been torn apart by civil war, the
‘kinstrife’, although this isn’t something they discuss openly with
27
Character II
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
outsiders As a result of this millennia-long struggle, Elves from
the war-torn north of Ulthuan tend to be hard-bitten, practical,
and ruthless
High Elven society is tightly-bound by ritual and discipline,
intended to keep soaring emotions in check and provide focus
for their complicated intellects Seeming contrary to this, some
Asur revel in wild adventure The term ‘Sea Elf ’ is often used by
other species to describe the dauntless High Elves who venture
beyond Ulthuan’s safe shores as mariners, traders, and diplomats,
and who stand in stark contrast to any grim Asur accompanying
them who follow warrior lifestyles
Opinions
On Reiklander Humans…
‘They are corrupt, jealous, and rapacious in their short-lived
hungers But, when mindful of their petty needs and their fear of
what we represent, they are easily shaped’
– Imryth Emberfell, Ambassador from Caledor
On Dwarfs…
‘I suggest avoiding them They are lost in the past, which blinds
them to what’s coming Nod politely, accept the abuse, and move
on There is no point arguing, they will never change their minds’
– Alathan Crestrider, Seaman from Cothique
On Halflings…
‘I find these cheerful creatures genuinely interesting I lived
amongst an extended family group for a while, and found them
so open, welcoming, and nurturing it was authentically touching
But, eventually, I had to move on, the smell was simply overpowering,
and they have no understanding of personal space,
which soon loses its charm’
– Hoelistor Arceye, Wizard from Saphery
On Wood Elves…
‘If the Asrai would bother to look beyond their dirty noses, they
would see what we are all up against Isolationist idiots that
deserve everything that’s coming to them I doubt the Eonir are
any better’
– Anaw-Alina Darkstep, Scout from Nagarythe
Wood Elves
Wood Elves are a rare sight in the Reikland, and for good reason
During the closing stages of the War of the Beard, most Elves
retreated from the Old World, but a few remained and withdrew
to the depths of the magical forests they now called home Over
three thousand years of isolation, hardship, and warfare then
ensued, leaving ‘Wood Elves’ culturally very different to their
High Elf cousins
Wood Elf life is entwined with nature, with a society intermixed
with spirits of the forest They are separatists who work hard to
hide themselves away, with arboreal outposts cunningly concealed
with powerful illusions and misleading magics On the rare
occasions they travel beyond their borders, it is usually for war, as
often with their neighbours as with darker forces, leaving other
peoples of the Old World deeply unsure of the fae, capricious
Elves
There are two kiths of Wood Elves most commonly seen
in Reikland The ‘Asrai’ from Athel Loren across the Grey
Mountains, and ‘Eonir’ of the Laurelorn Forest far to the north
in Nordland
The ruthless Asrai of Athel Loren are xenophobic and secretive,
and rarely venture beyond their borders However, a decade ago,
Naith the Prophetess foresaw the possible death of Athel Loren
In response, the King and Queen of the Wood, recognising
the fate of their forests may lay in the hands of outsiders, sent
tattooed kinbands out from Athel Loren to take action, hunting
the enemies of the forest at the source
These ferocious bands are sometimes led by a spellsinger who
calls upon the old, magical paths of the Worldroot to transport
them between Athel Loren and the depths of other forests long
lost to the Elves, but not yet consumed by civilisation or Chaos
Occasionally, these wild hunters perceive some common cause
with other Old Worlders and an individual may step from the
shadows to join with those fighting a greater evil
28
II
By comparison, the Queen of the Laurelorn takes a very
different path to the foretellings given to her and has recently
sent a sizeable delegation to make camp in the deep forest of the
Amber Hills just south of Altdorf These Elves observe Human
politics concerning the Laurelorn and beyond, and occasionally
intervene on matters deemed important The camp is viewed as a
‘temporary’ solution by the Elves, but the meaning of that word
is very different to the long-lived species Because of this camp,
these Wood Elves are a growing presence in Reikland as they
venture from the trees and wander according to their inscrutable
purposes, often as hunters or entertainers
Opinions
On Reiklander Humans…
‘I see hateful creatures with darkness in their hearts and a
complete disrespect for order But they are widespread, warlike,
and, most importantly, easy to manipulate Given winter draws
near, it is time to use them’
– Algwyllmyr Twiceseen, Seer from Athel Loren
On Dwarfs…
‘More stubborn than the Oak of Ages, they understand one
argument only: force So, use it swiftly and decisively, and be
aware they will return for petty vengeance at a later date’
– Meridrynda Aspengate, Glade Rider from Athel Loren
On Halflings…
‘I met one when travelling Middenland during the ninth year of
Queen Marrisith It talked a lot And I do mean a lot When we
parted ways by a town it told me was named “Delberz”, I found it
had somehow managed to steal several pouches of herbs from my
belt I was impressed So, I suggest not trusting the things, but the
companionship and local lore they share may be worth the cost!’
– Alafael Harrowlay, Entertainer from the Laurelorn
On High Elves…
‘Conceited beyond any sensible measure, don’t approach the Asur
They are jaded, arrogant, and likely lost to Atharti And if they
try to look down on you in that superior manner they so prefer,
just remind them their Queen in Avelorn lives a life no different
to ours’
– Cynwrawn Fartrack, Hunter from the Laurelorn
Sylvan Cousins
The Wood Elves of Athel Loren and the Laurelorn may share
a common history and origin in the Old World, but they
are culturally different Unlike the High Elves, neither of the
Wood Elven kiths care much for any form of conventional
civilisation, seeing it as a threat to their beloved forests and
way of life However, they differ in how they choose to express
this
The Laurelorn Wood Elves proactively engage in politics to
protect themselves, mixing with others, and are not above
stoking the fires of hatred between other groups to shift focus
to their preferred targets Thus, in character, they are more
like the High Elves, whilst still having the Skills and Talents
of the Wood Elves
By comparison, the Athel Loren kinbands prefer to hide in
the shadows, shunning contact with all others, instead striking
deadly blows designed to cause fear and terror in the hearts of
any who would look to the forest with greed

Career
Summary: Choose one of your Class’s Careers, restricted by your
Species
Once your Class is established, choose one of the Careers
associated with it There are 8 Careers in each Class, but some
are restricted by Species Full descriptions of each Career and
their restrictions are given in Chapter 3: Class and Careers,
but for a quick reference, refer to the Random Class and Career
Table to see a complete list of every Career and any Species
restrictions
Options:
But I want to play a
Wood Elf Flage llant!
You may have a great idea for a character excluded by the
rules because normally the species in question doesn’t pursue
such a career for cultural, religious, or philosophical reasons
That’s totally fine! Just take your character concept to your
GM and, if you both agree to the unique combination, you’re
good to go
3) Attributes
Summary: Determine each of your Attributes by referring to the
Attributes Table
Attributes describe your character’s innate capabilities – how fast
or strong you are, how much damage you can sustain, or how well
you cope with stressful situations Attributes include Movement,
ten Characteristics, Wounds, Fate, and Resilience
Wait! That’s not fair!
You may notice that not all characters are created equal
An Elf has significant Characteristic advantages, for example
Don’t be deceived by numbers alone, there are many aspects
to character generation and all the Species have advantages and
disadvantages at each stage, some of them not always obvious
Characteristics
Your ten Characteristics are used in Tests (see Chapter 5:
Rules), to determine if you perform an action successfully The
Human average for these Attributes is 30 Those who are gifted,
or well-practiced, may achieve scores of over 40; only the most
dedicated and experienced will achieve scores over 60 Of course,
other Species have their own strengths and weaknesses, so their
averages are different, sometimes significantly so
Determining Characteristics
When determining your Characteristics:
Step 1) Roll 2d10 for each of the ten Characteristics and
make a note of the results If you feel your Character would be
improved if you swapped round some of the dice roll results
between Characteristics, move to the next step If you stick with
your random results, add the die rolls to the modifier for each
Characteristic from the Attribute Table, write them on your
Character Sheet and gain +50 XP
Step 2) Rearrange the ten numbers rolled under step 1, assigning
each to a different Characteristic (and adding its modifier) If
you’re happy with this new mix, record them on your Character
Sheet and gain +25 XP If not, move to the next step
Step 3) If you’re still not happy with your results, either roll again
and swap the rolls around with no XP bonus, or you could ignore
the dice completely! Instead, allocate 100 points across the 10
Characteristics as you prefer, with a minimum of 4 and a maximum
of 18 allocated to any single Characteristic Add the modifiers from
the Attribute Table and record them on your Character Sheet Like
rolling again, there is no XP bonus for this option
Weapon Skill (WS)
Your skill at fighting hand-to-hand, your ability to land a
measured blow, and effectiveness in the free-for-all of a massed
melee It is also used for unarmed combat, where your body is
the weapon!

Character II
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Ballistic Skill (BS)
Your effectiveness at hitting with ranged weapons like bows and
throwing knives, and for throwing things generally It is also used
as the basis for other ranged attacks like Trolls vomiting
Strength (S)
How much damage you do in melee, how much you can lift, and
how good you are at things like swimming and climbing
Toughness (T)
Your physical hardiness It helps you survive damage in combat
but will also help with things like surviving harsh conditions and
standing up to poison
Initiative (I)
Speed of thought and reaction, especially in the heat of battle and
when under pressure It determines combat order, and helps you
be the first to react to danger It also determines your powers of
intuition and perception
Agility (Ag)
Physical coordination and natural athleticism, and the basis for
things like running, riding, and hiding Agility is also used for
dodging blows in combat
Dexterity (Dex)
Your affinity for performing fine and delicate manual tasks like
playing a musical instrument or skilled manufacturing It will also
help you with things like sleight of hand and picking pockets
Intelligence (Int)
Your powers of thought, analysis, and understanding Useful
for healing, evaluating, and general knowledge, and vital for the
understanding and casting of magical spells
Willpower (WP)
General strength of mind, and your ability to shrug off difficulty
and plough on with the job in hand It helps with resisting all
sorts of influence and coercion, and guards against fear and terror
Fellowship (Fel)
Your ability to get on with people and come across as generally
pleasant and acceptable It will help you when chatting to locals or
commanding people in battle, charming the guards or attempting
to bribe them, and, for pious characters, communicating with
your deity
Characteristic Bonuses
The first or ‘tens’ digit of each Characteristic is its bonus value
Characteristic Bonuses are used in a variety of different ways
throughout the rules, particularly for limiting Talents and
defining Spells
Example: Strength (S) 39 equates to a Strength Bonus of 3
Willpower (WP) of 51 equals a Willpower Bonus of 5
Wounds (W)
Your Wounds show how much Damage you can endure based on
your physical power and your force of will to shrug off injury See
Chapter 5: Rules for how Wounds are used to track Damage
Determining Wounds
Unlike other Attributes, Wounds are derived from your Strength
Bonus, twice your Toughness Bonus,, and Willpower Bonus
(abbreviated to SB, TB, and WPB on the Attributes Table) Refer
to the Attributes Table to determine the Characteristic Bonuses
used to calculate your Wounds Note: Halflings have the Small
Talent automatically and start with fewer Wounds, (see page 341)
Fate & Fortune, Resilience & Resolve
Your Fate represents your destiny, and is directly tied to your
Fortune, a measure of your luck Your Resilience is your inner
strength, which is directly related to your Resolve, defining your
grit Your Resilience also comes with a Motivation, which is a
single word or phrase describing what drives your character
forwards See page 170 for more on all of these
Determining Fate and Resilience
You start with a base value for Fate and Resilience, and then have
a number of Extra Points to spread between these two Attributes
as you see fit The numbers for these are shown in the Attributes
Table The more points you allocate to Fate, the luckier you are
By comparison, a higher Resilience shows you can steel through
any situation
Determining Fortune and Resolve
Your initial Fortune is equal to your Fate Your initial Resolve
equals your Resilience Mark all four values on your sheet
Determining Motivation
All characters choose a Motivation It represents your Character’s
core essence, a word or phrase that sums up what you live for In
addition to the obvious roleplaying benefits for portraying your
character, Motivation is used to help you regain Resolve points
When considering your Motivation, think of something that
is fundamental to your character’s nature Also try to make your
Motivation something fun to roleplay, and something that will
work well with the other PCs and their motivations
Example: Gustavus, a young Scholar at the University in Altdorf,
has ‘Thrillseeker’ for his Motivation He lives his life in pursuit of
excitement and danger, and Gustavus may regain Resolve points
when he actively seeks out risky situations; perhaps he provokes
antagonism in taverns, or deliberately breaks the law by stealing
the feathers from the caps of State Soldiers
Example: Clotilda, a Reiksguard Knight, has ‘Protect the weak’ as
her Motivation She is driven to stand up to bullies and braggarts,
risking life and limb to save the Reikland’s citizenry Clotilda will
regain her Resolve whenever she rescues others, or puts herself in
harm’s way to protect another
34
II
Example: Ebba is a ‘Rebellious’ apprentice wizard studying at
the Light College She loves to break the rules of the College,
flaunting her master’s authority, and poking her nose into books
best left undisturbed She regains Resolve whenever she breaks
the rules set for her by superiors
Other examples of potential motivations include: a
‘Perfectionist’, who loves to plan meticulously and draws energy
from flawless execution of schemes; a ‘Nurturer’, who gains
strength from caring for others, or rescuing them from difficult
situations; a ‘Penitent Martyr’, who revels in hardship to atone
for past misdeeds; or a ‘Shining Wit’, who’s ever engaging in
witty badinage and banter to lighten the mood If you can’t think
of a Motivation don’t worry One may arise as you create more of
your character, and the other players and the GM can always help
Even if you do have one, it’s possible you may change your mind
later Step 8) Bringing Your Character To Life is a good time to
reconsider what your Motivation will be
Movement (M)
Movement is used to determine your Walk and Run speed
Standard Human Movement is 4 If using a grid for movement
this indicates how many squares you can move in a Round, or
inches across the table top Over the longer term it indicates how
many miles per hour you can comfortably travel on foot For
more on Movement, see page 164

Advance Characteristics
Turn to your career in Chapter 3: Class and Careers Look to
the Advance Scheme and find the three Characteristics marked
h without a brass, silver, or gold background You can allocate a
total of 5 Advances across these Characteristics as you choose,
and mark them in the Advances box on your Character Sheet
Characteristic Advances
Characteristic Advances show training or experience in your
Characteristics The number of Advances you have in the
Characteristic is added to the initial Characteristic to show
your current ability So, if you have an initial Dexterity of 25,
and 5 Dexterity Advances, your Dexterity is now 30
4) Skills and Talents
Summary: Choose your Skills and Talents from those offered by
your Species and Career
Skills represent areas of trained learning or experience, and
Talents describe special abilities your Character can access A
list of all Skills and Talents is provided in Chapter 4: Skills
and Talents The Skills and Talents you have available to you at
character generation are determined by your Species and Career
When you learn a Skill, note down the number of Advances you
gain in the Advances box of the Skill If you should learn this
skill again, add the extra Advances to the old total to create a
new number of Advances If you learn a Talent, record it in your
Talent list on your Character Sheet
Skills are classified as either Basic or Advanced Basic Skills
represent common abilities that everyone can perform — you can
use these skills without any Advances in them, at a level equal
to the governing characteristic Advanced Skills require specialist
knowledge, and you can only use these skills if you have taken at
least one Advance in them
Note: Some Talents can be learned multiple times If you have
an opportunity to learn a Talent a second time, check the Talent
entry in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents to see if it can be learned
multiple times, and mark how many times you’ve learned it on
your Character Sheet
35
Character II
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
What Are Skill Advances?
Like Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances show
specific training in a Skill All Skills are associated with a
Characteristic, and the number of Advances you have in the
Skill is added to that Characteristic to show you how skilled
you are So, as Climb is associated with Strength, if you have
a Strength of 38, and 8 Climb Advances, your Climb Skill
is 46 This is explained in full in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents
Species Skills and Talents
Each Species has a variety of Skills and Talents to choose from
You may choose 3 Skills to gain 5 Advances each, and 3 Skills
to gain 3 Advances each If a Talent listing presents a choice, you
select one Talent from the choices given Any Random Talents are
determined by the Random Talent table If you roll a Talent you
already have, you may reroll Note: All Characters are assumed to
be fluent in Reikspiel,, the language of the Empire, and do not
need to take it as a Skill For more on this, see page 124

Career Skills and Talents
Now turn to your career in Chapter 3: Class and Careers You
begin at the first Career level listed in your Career Path There are
8 Skills and 4 Talents listed with that level, and you can choose
which of these you are most proficient at Allocate 40 Advances
to your eight starting Skills, with no more than 10 Advances
allocated to any single Skill at this stage This is enough for you
to add 5 Advances to every Career Skill if you wish, which is one
of the required steps to complete your Career if you wish to move
to a new one (see Changing Career on page 48) You may also
choose a single Talent to learn
Example: Lindsay is creating a Human Noble Scion, which has
the following Career Skills: Bribery, Consume Alcohol, Gamble,
Intimidate, Leadership, Lore (Heraldry), Melee (Fencing), Play
(Any) She decides the character is well-schooled, but naive, so
chooses to ignore the Bribery, Consume Alcohol, and Gamble
Skills for the moment, and spreads her 40 Advances like so:
Intimidate +7, Leadership +10, Lore (Heraldry) +10, Melee
(Fencing) +3, and Play (Harpsichord) +10 Note: Lindsay can do
this even if she has already allocated Advances to Leadership for
being Human, as the limit of 10 Advances to a single Skill applies
only during this allocation of 40 Advances

5) Trappings
Summary: Determine your initial Trappings from your Class and
Career
Your Trappings are the equipment, clothes, weapons, and other
items your character carries You begin play with initial Trappings
determined by your Class and your Career If you want to buy
more (or sell what you already have!), refer to Chapter 11:
Consumers’ Guide
All your Trappings should be recorded in the relevant sections
of your Character Sheet Once you’ve done this, move on to 6)
Adding Detail
Class Trappings
Your character begins play with general Trappings determined
by your Class Reference your Class in the list below and jot the
Trappings into your Character Sheet, rolling dice where required
Academics: Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing
Writing Kit and 1d10 sheets of Parchment
Burghers: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Hat, Pouch, Sling Bag
containing Lunch
Courtiers: Courtly Garb, Dagger, Pouch containing Tweezers,
Ear Pick, and a Comb
Peasants: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing
Rations (1 day)
Rangers: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Backpack containing
Tinderbox, Blanket, Rations (1 day)
Riverfolk: Cloak, Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag
containing a Flask of Spirits
Rogues: Clothing, Dagger, Pouch, Sling Bag containing 2
Candles, 1d10 Matches, a Hood or Mask
Warriors: Clothing, Hand Weapon, Dagger, Pouch
Career Trappings
Every Career has a list of Trappings for each of its four levels You
begin play with all the Trappings listed in the first level of your
Career Path Find the appropriate Trappings list in Chapter 3:
Class and Careers and record them on your Character Sheet
Next, find your character’s Status, which is listed beside your
Career level’s name It will be marked as either Brass, Silver or
Gold, which is you Status Tier, followed by a a number, which is
your Status Level Your Status tier and Status Level determine
your initial wealth as shown below
Status Tier Starting Wealth
Brass 2d10 brass pennies per Status Level
Silver 1d10 silver shillings per Status Level
Gold 1 Gold crown per Status Level
So, if you were Brass 3, you would start with 6d10 Brass pennies;
if Silver 3, you would begin with 3d10 silver shillings, and if you
were Gold 3, you would have 3 gold crowns
This money can be used to purchase more Trappings or saved for
spending during play The relative worth of the coins is covered in
Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide
6) Adding Detail
Summary: Choose name, age, hair and eye colour, height,
Psychology, and Ambitions
The bare bones of your character are in place, so let’s add some
details, fleshing your character out in your imagination, determining
what you look like, how you think, and what drives you
Name
While you can choose any name that fits the world, here are some
hints and tips to help choose one that’s right for you
Human Reiklander Names
Reiklanders usually have a forename and a surname Forenames
include:
Examples: Adhemar, Anders, Artur, Beatrijs, Clementia, Detlev,
Erika, Frauke, Frederich, Gerner, Gertraud, Haletha, Heinrich,
Helga, Henryk, Irmina, Jehanne, Karl, Kruger, Lorelay, Marieke,
Sebastien, Sigfreda, Talther, Talunda, Ulrich, Ulrika, Werther,
Willelma, Wilryn

Character II
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Human Names
and their Origins
Human names in WFRP are often taken from the real world,
making it easy to research fun names online The Reikland and
much of The Empire uses Germanic names, the Wasteland
has Dutch and Belgian influences, and Bretonnian names are
loosely medieval French
In the Reikland, Human family surnames passed on from
one generation to the next are most common in cities and
towns, while in villages Humans are more likely to take on an
individual surname when they reach adulthood It’s common
to take a surname from where you were born, such as ‘Wilhelm
of Auerswald’ The nobility often have two surnames, one is the
name of their House and the other is preceded by ‘von’ to indicate
where their family holds land, such as Graf Zenechar Trott von
Tahme, though individual family traditions vary widely
The most common surnames are derived from your occupation,
or the occupation of a parent or grandparent Examples include:
Bauer (Farmer), Fleischer (Butcher), Schmidt (Smith), and
Schuster (Cobbler) If a character has a particularly noticeable
physical trait, this might be used as a surname This can often
be passed down from parents to children too, which can become
confusing for literal-minded Dwarfs who may not understand a
short person claiming to be Lang (Tall) Some other examples
include: Augenlos (one eye), Dunn (very thin), Laut (loud
voice), Stark (Strong)
Dwarf Names
Dwarf names are comprised of a forename, a surname, and a clan
name
Dwarf Forenames
Dwarf names tend to be short and sturdy like the people they
represent, and are most commonly given to celebrate important
ancestors, although individual clan traditions vary Another
common practice is to use a birthname to describe a key trait of a
newborn in Khazalid, the Dwarf native language
Examples: Alrik, Bronda, Dimzad, Fenna, Gottri, Gudrun,
Snorri
Khazalid examples: Baragaz (Cannon Mouth), Durak (Hard),
Galazil (Golden Haired), Gnoldok (Wise Eyes), Nazril
(Shimmering), Okri (Crafter)
Dwarf Surnames
Dwarf surnames are based on who raised the Dwarf, with the
following suffixes the most common in use:
-sdottir: Daughter of…
-snev: Nephew of…
-sniz: Niece of…
-sson: Son of…
Examples: Ariksson, Grunnasdottir, Skagnev, Sovrissniz
It’s common as Dwarfs age and accrue deeds to their names
to adopt a nickname based on physical appearance, prowess,
or deed These are usually bestowed by clan consensus, and it’s
considered dishonourable to give a name that doesn’t represent
the true character of a Dwarf If such a nickname is adopted, it
usually replaces the surname completely So, Gerka Kardadottir
would become Gerka Blackhand if she took the nickname
‘Blackhand’ Sometimes a nickname is marked in Khazalid, but
Dwarfs usually translate such to Reikspiel in order to better
explain themselves
Examples: Axebringer, Finehand, Forkbeard, Ironbraid,
Redhammer, Stonefist
Clan Name
Finally, all Dwarfs bear a Clan Name (assuming they have not
abandoned Dwarf tradition, which some Dwarfs living in the
Empire have, especially rogue engineers) The Clan Name is
always derived from the ancestor who founded the Clan, and
is often sourced in a Nickname, often expressed in Khazalid
In practice, Dwarfs rarely use their Clan Name outside Dwarf
society
Common Reikland Clans: Ardrungan, Bryntok, Gazani,
Gromheld, Harrazlings, Unboki
Common Grey Mountain Clans: Dokkintroll, Ganvalgger,
Kvitang, Thrungtak, Wyrgrinti, Zankonk
Elf Names
Elves normally only admit to having names comprising of a
forename and an epithet when wandering the Reikland
Elf Forenames
The Elves use a naming system quite incomprehensible to
outsiders Eltharin (the common language of High Elves and
Wood Elves, which has many dialects) is a language that relies on
more than simple syllables to convey meaning The easiest way to
create an Elf name is to use the Elf Name Generator
Elf Epithets
When travelling foreign lands, Elves typically present themselves
with a forename and an epithet rather than attempt to explain
the deeper concepts of Kindreds, Kinbands, or Houses These
epithets are always translated into Reikspiel as they are much
38
II
easier for other species to pronounce and understand Among
High Elves, epithets usually describe character traits and physical
appearance, but can be more obscure Wood Elf epithets typically
reference the natural world so beloved by the forest kin
High Elf examples: Emberfell, Fireborn, Foamheart,
Goldenhair, Silverspray, Spellsign
Wood Elf examples: Fleetriver, Shadowstalker, Treeshaper,
Weavewatcher, Willowlimb, Windrunner
Halfling Names
Halfling names are comprised of a given name and a clan name
at a minimum, with middle names included to ensure family trees
are not confused
Halfling Forenames
Halflings proudly bear grand names drawn from their long
family trees, but they rarely use these outside official business
Normally, they are known by a cosy-sounding shortened form of
their ancestral name Some Halfling’s diminutives are completely
unrelated to their formal names and are instead more descriptive,
like Rosie or Scrumper
Halflings place great stock in their achievements and some elders
will only answer to nicknames related to their job, such as Gaffer,
Guv, or Nan Halflings also have long had a habit of emulating
their neighbours to the point that many grand, formerly-Human
names have now become ‘traditional’ Halfling names
Examples (with diminutives): Antoniella (Anni), Esmerelda
(Esme), Ferdinand (Fred), Heironymus (Hiro), Maximilian
(Max), Theodosius (Theo), Thomasina (Tina)
Halfling Clan Names
Halfling clan names are almost exclusively related to food and
drink, geographical or natural features, or personal characteristics
of the ancestor who first took the name Halflings who have the
same surname are always related and can usually tell you exactly
how
Human’s tendency to have the same surname despite being
unrelated causes confusion among some Halflings, who will
happily pinch pies from a Schmidt on one street because a
Schmidt on another street short-changed them
Common Reikland Clans: Ashfield, Brandysnap, Hayfoot,
Rumster, Shortbottom, Thorncobble
Physical Details
When it comes to cosmetic physical details — those aspects of
your appearance that don’t influence the game directly — you
may either roll them randomly or choose from the range available
to your Species
Age
Average natural lifespans are around 60 for a Human, 120 for
Halflings, and over 200 for a Dwarf, while Elves don’t appear to
age at all and have been known to live for a thousand years or
more Choose your Character’s age or use the table below

Character II
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Eye Colour
While most species roll once on the table below, Elves may
roll twice: their innately magical natures mean they often have
variegated colours, such as sapphire blue flecked with gold, or a
mottled mixture of mossy green and warm chestnut
Hair Colour
All species barring Elves have hair that slowly turns grey as they
move through middle age, then eventually turns white as they
reach old age
By comparison, Elves seem eternally youthful, never showing any
signs of age Humans and Dwarfs may also have significant facial
hair, which is usually the same colour as head hair, but not always
Height
Average heights are: Dwarf (4’8”), Elf (6’5”), Halfling (3’6”),
with Humans varying much more widely, averaging somewhere
around 5’9” in the Reikland If you want a truly random upper
height for Humans, if either die rolls a 10, roll one more die and
add it to the height total
Human Dwarf Elf Halfling

Ambitions
Ambitions are a Character’s goals in life – what they want to
achieve All characters have both a Short-Term and Long-Term
Ambition
Choosing Ambitions
Consult with your GM when choosing your Ambitions Your
GM has final say on the acceptability of an Ambition, and
whether it is short-term or long-term Should you wish to change
an Ambition, you may do so between sessions
Short-term Ambitions
Short-term Ambitions represent your immediate goals They are
outcomes you wish to achieve within days and weeks, possibly

sooner Under normal circumstances, a short-term Ambition
should take at least two or three sessions to complete
Example short-term Ambitions include:
	 Ruining the reputation of a romantic rival
	 Avenging a fallen comrade
	 Befriending a reclusive scholar
Long-term Ambitions
Long-term Ambitions are goals you will need to work on for
months or years to complete, and may never be achieved at all,
perhaps taken more as a description of a primary motivation in
your life than a realistic outcome
Examples of long-term Ambitions include:
	 Owning your own coaching inn
	 Building your village into a thriving town
	 Ridding the Colleges of Magic of Elven influence
Options: Nefarious Plans
You may want to keep your Ambitions secret from other
players in your party, especially if they are controversial or
clandestine If you want to overthrow the Emperor, or legalise
Necromancy in the Reikland, chances are your Witch Hunter
ally won’t approve!
Achieving Your Ambitions
If you achieve your short-term Ambition, you will receive a bonus
of +50 XP, and can choose a new short-term Ambition at the
end of the session If you achieve your long-term Ambition, you
may either:
	 Receive a bonus of +500 XP and choose a new long-term
Ambition at the end of the session
	 Retire your Character — who becomes an NPC under your
GM’s control — and gain a bonus of half your earned XP
of your current character to spend on your next character
Retired Characters will generally stay in place to take advantage of
their achieved ambition You can build them into the background
of your new Character, so that they may continue to help you If
you want to reactivate a retired Character, talk to your GM about
how best to bring that into the current story Retiring Characters
allows you to build a network across the Old World, and can be a
great source of adventure leads
7) Part y
Now you have almost finished making your Character, you need
to consider the other players in your party Everyone will have
more fun when your Characters can engage and interact with one
another; while some intra-party tension can be enjoyable, it is
important you are not constantly at one another’s throats
You will also want to consider how your party know one another
Are you friends? Are you the retainers of a noble, or travelling
companions on a river barge? Or is your GM going to have you
meet during your first session?
Party Ambitions
All players in your group should also discuss what your collective
goals are, and then choose a short-term and long-term party
Ambition Much like your personal Ambitions, party Ambitions
can be changed between sessions
Short-term Party Ambitions
Short-term party Ambitions have the same scope as your personal
short-term Ambitions but are for the whole group Your personal
Ambitions should never be the same as your party Ambitions, but
there is no reason they can’t complement each other
41
Character II
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Examples of short-term party Ambitions include:
	 Outwitting a rival group, securing a job at their loss
	 Hunting down the killer of a lost party member
	 Impressing your patron by completely succeeding in an
appointed task
Long-term Party Ambitions
Much like short-term party Ambitions, long-term Party
Ambitions work like your personal Ambitions, and can be just as
wide in scope, but are for your entire group
Examples of long-term Party Ambitions include:
	 Eradicate an Empire-wide Chaos Cult
	 Build a castle
	 Become Heroes of the Empire, each earning an Imperial
Cross for bravery, pinned on your chests by the Emperor
himself!
Achieving your Party Ambitions
If your party achieves its short-term Ambition, each member
receives +50 XP, and you can all select a new Ambition for the
party at the end of the session
If your party achieves its long-term Party Ambition:
	 All players receive a bonus of +500 XP, and the party chooses
a new long-term Ambition at the end of the session
	 As many players as wish to do so can retire their Characters
— who become NPCs under the GM’s control; those who
do gain a bonus of half the XP of their current Character to
spend on their next Character
8) Bringing Your
Character to Life
Fleshing out your Character’s personality and history will
really help you bring them to life Some players write detailed
backstories for their Character, especially if they are very familiar
with the Old World Others prefer to just decide the basics at the
start, and then improvise during the game (discuss this with the
GM beforehand so you don’t derail any storylines) At the start of
the Character creation process we recommended that you talk to
the other players and the GM about the kind of group you want
to create, and we revisited that while creating Party ambitions
This is the perfect place to complete that process, weaving your
Characters’ stories together and binding them into a tight-knit
group with their own reasons for sticking together
Ten Questions
One useful technique for creating an interesting background for
your Character is to answer a series of questions about them —
here are ours! If any of these questions make you want to change
something about the character you’ve created so far do so! For
instance, if you add in some detail about your childhood, you may
want to revisit the choices you made in 4) Skills and Talents
Where are you from?
Do you come from one of Reikland’s bustling towns, or a sleepy
village? Perhaps your childhood was spent on a remote farmstead,
or maybe you called the winding back alleys of Altdorf home?
Do you hail from a deep mountain hold, or were your days spent
threading the roads and riverways of Reikland, always on the
move? See Chapter 10: Glorious Reikland for details on the
geography and settlements of this corner of the Empire
What is your family like?
It may take a village to raise a child, but it’s your kin who do
the heavy lifting What were your parents’ occupations? Are they
still alive? Do you have any siblings? Were you close, or were
you constantly at one another’s throats? Grandparents? Nephews,
nieces, cousins? Children, even? Does your family approve of
your career choice? Are they proud of you, or are you a stain on
your family’s honour?
What was your childhood like?
Was your family home full of love, or was it a cold, inhospitable
place? Were you coddled, or did you have to fend for yourself?
Were you educated, and if so, by whom: a tutor, a family member,
a village school, or the local priest? Were you trained in the
family business, or were you sent from home, fostered elsewhere
or raised in an orphanage?
Why did you leave home?
Do you still live in your childhood home, or did you leave? If
so, when? Were you drawn by the promise of excitement of life
in the big city? Are you in search of riches, or renown? Are you
running from something, or trying to find meaning or purpose
in your life?
Who are your best friends?
While you cannot choose your family, your friends are another
matter entirely, and you can tell a lot about someone by the
friends they keep Do you have any friends from childhood?
Or friends you’ve made since leaving home? What do you do
together? Drink? Gamble? Debate? Are your allies in your party
your best friends? Or do you eschew civilised company in favour
of a loyal pet?
What is your greatest desire?
What is the fire that burns in your heart? Your Ambitions may
be your chief goal, but ambitions are often prosaic or banal If you
could have anything, anything at all, what would it be?
What are your best and worst memories?
We are the sum of our experiences; they shape and mould us,
forging us anew What are your most treasured memories? An
afternoon of glorious summer sunshine? A passionate kiss,
II
42
while huddling from rain, beneath sheltering boughs? A victory
scored in a battle of wits or brawn? And what are your less fond
recollections? A painful humiliation? A scheme thwarted? The
end of a long-term partnership, romantic or business? The hatred,
disdain, or, worse, disinterest of your peers?
What are your religious beliefs?
Most folk of the Empire are polytheistic; the existence, and
puissance, of the gods is undeniable, and so their veneration
is a matter of course That being said, not all of the gods are
favoured equally
Does your character have a fondness or affinity for one god
in particular? Do you cross your fingers for luck, appealing to
Ranald? Do you make the sign of the Twin Tailed Comet at
your enemy, or mutter an angry prayer to Ulric before battle?
See Chapter 7: Religion and Belief for details of the gods and
their ways
To whom, or what, are you loyal?
Will you protect your friends above all, or are the ties that bind
you to your clan, kinfolk, or partner stronger than iron? Or are
you a pious soul, dedicated above all to your god? Or are you
loyal to your community, to Reikland, the Empire… or just to
yourself?
Why are you adventuring?
And this is the big one: why are you a player character, and not
just another citizen of the Empire Why are you adventuring?
Have you consciously chosen a life of adventure? Are you seeking
out the enemies of the Empire, or a big pay day? Or was this life
thrust upon you, against your will Are you seeking justice, or
vengeance, or is your adventuring life nothing more than a fight
to clear your name, or survive your enemies?
Answer all of those, and you will have a fully fleshed out character,
ready to go But, before you start playing, did you gain any bonus
XP during the character creation process? If so, you may wish to
spend it before you begin play
Options: Psychology
When you are creating your Character’s story, you might feel
you should have powerful emotions such as Love, Camaraderie,
Hatred etc towards family members, situations, enemies or
other features of their life If the GM agrees, you can take a
Psychology trait (see page 190)
9) Advancement
Experience Points (XP) are used to improve your character
The GM will give you XP after every session of play, and you
may be rewarded for doing particularly well This could include
successfully resolving the ongoing adventure, roleplaying your
character well or defeating important enemies Between sessions,
you spend your XP to buy new Skills and Talents, to increase
Characteristics, and to change Career The final step in creating
your Character is to spend any bonus XP you earned through the
Character Creation process The tables below shows how you can
spend these points
Initially, you can only spend your XP to increase the 3
Characteristics, 8 Skills, and 4 Talents available to your Career
level For more details on spending XP, see page 47

Personal Details
Here is where you fill in your Character’s
personal details, such as name, Species (see
page 24) and Career (see page 30), as well as
aspects of their physical appearance
Attributes
Record your Attributes here Attributes
include your Characteristics (see page 33),
which describe your Character’s strengths and
weaknesses As you progress through your
game, your Character will gain Advances (see
page 35), reflecting them getting stronger,
tougher or better at different tasks
Your Movement (see page 35) shows how
quickly you can move
Fate and Fortune (see page 170) reflect how
lucky your character is, while Resilience and
Resolve (see page 171) indicate your character’s
pool of grit and determination to overcome
certain obstacles You will also need to record a
Motivation (see page 34), which explains what
keeps your Character going
Skills & Talents
Your Skills (see page 35) are abilities your
character can train or develop Basic Skills
are common or innate and are known by all
characters, while Advanced Skills require
training As you acquire new Skills, mark them
onto your Character Sheet As you get gain
Advances, your Skills will improve, which
increase your chance of succeeding in Tests (see
page 149)
Talents are additional abilities your character
possesses As many Talents may be taken more
than once, keep a tally of how many times you
have taken each one
Ambitions
Your Ambitions (see page 41) are your
Character and party’s main goals in life
Short-term Ambitions can be achieved
within a few days or weeks, while longterm
Ambitions are those that may take
years, or may never be achieved at all
Experience
As you play WFRP your Gamemaster will award
Experience Points (see page 43) Keep a record of
your current (unspent) Experience, as well as your
Spent Experience and a running total
Character Sheet Summary









Party
Details about your group goes here: the
name your party is known by, and its
short-term and long-term Ambitions (see
pages 41-42) There’s also space to note your
companions’ names as a reminder to use
them and help everyone stay in character

45
Character II
Spells and Prayers
If your character is in a religious or magical
Career, you may have access to Spells (see page
238) or Prayers (see page 217) These represent
supernatural abilities, as your characters draws on
the winds of magic, or calls on their favoured deity
for assistance in times of need
Weapons
Record details about your Weapons (see page 293)
here As well as the type of Weapon, you will also
record its Encumbrance (how heavy it is), how
much Damage it inflicts, and, if it is a Ranged
Weapon, at what Range it can be used
Wounds
Record your Wounds (see page 34) here Your
Wounds are derived from your Characteristics
and Talents As you are injured in Combat
(see page 156) your Wounds will go down,
while Healing (see page 181) will increase
them again (though never beyond your
maximum) As you gain Advances in your
Characteristics and Talents, your Wounds may,
in turn, increase
Armour
Record your Armour (see page 299) here Armour is
very useful at keeping your character alive, as it reduces
incoming Damage, and may save you from Critical Hits
(see page 159) Record the details of your Armour in the
table, and also write the total Armour Points (APs) in each
location on the diagram
Psychology
If your character has any Psychology (see
page 190) record it here Psychologies include
phobias, animosities and strong loyalties Most
starting characters do not begin with any
Psychologies
Trappings, Encumbrance,
and Wealth
Your Trappings (see page 37) are your
belongings These may include clothing, bags,
candles, ropes, or bandages As your character
is limited in how much they can carry, you
must also record each item’s Encumbrance
(see page 293) Add up the total Encumbrance
of your Armour, Weapons, and Trappings to
see how much weight you are carrying
Your character’s Wealth is recorded in brass
pennies, silver shillings, and, if you’re especially
wealthy, gold crowns Spend it wisely!








Corruption and Mutation
When you face dark horrors, Daemons, and the machinations of the
Dark Gods, you may gain Corruption Points (see 182) Gathering too
many of these can quickly lead to mutation (see page 183)

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Class and Careers
‘Well, I play a character with no class at all who would sell his
grandmother for career advancement; you know, exactly the type of
fellow frequently encountered in my line of work’
– Detlef Sierck, Playwright and Actor
Your Career is your job when not off adventuring (or having
adventures done to you, as may often be the case) It describes
your training, social class, and your future prospects WFRP
groups similar Careers into Classes
Classes
A summary of each Class is found in Chapter 2: Character on
page 30 Classes organise Careers into easily referenced groups
They also impact character development, provide different
starting Trappings during Character Creation (see page 37), and
influence how you can change Career (see Changing Career on
page 48) Some Classes have access to different Endeavours —
activities you can take between adventures; for more on this, see
Chapter 6: Between Adventures
Classes
Academics: Page 53
Burghers: Page 61
Courtiers: Page 69
Peasants: Page 77
Rangers: Page 85

Warriors: Page 109
Careers
The summary and illustration at the top of the eight Careers in
your chosen Class should give you a good idea of which is the one
for you The Careers can be considered to be as broad as possible,
so you are encouraged to interpret them imaginatively as part of
your Character concept
III
 
Career Levels
Every Career has four levels, each progressively better than the
last If you take a look at Apothecary, the first Academic Career,
you can see the four levels are:
1 Apprentice Apothecary
2 Apothecary
3 Master Apothecary
4 Apothecary-General
When choosing a Career for a new character, you always start at
the first level of the career — so, if you were an Apothecary, you
would start as an Apprentice Apothecary
Advancing Through Your Career
Your Character’s Career affects how they will grow through
experience Every Career offers three forms of Advances:
Characteristic Advances, Skill Advances, and Talent Advances
— each of which are purchased with Experience Points (XP) You
can also use XP to Change Career Your Career Level determines
what Characteristics, Skills, and Talents are available to you
Characteristic Advances
Every Career has an Advance Scheme governing its
Characteristic Advances The Advance Scheme shows your
character’s 10 Characteristics, 3 marked with h, 1 marked with
 on a brass background, 1 marked with a on silver, and the
last marked on gold
The three marked h are Characteristics you can advance in the
first level of the Career When you enter the second level of a
career, the Characteristic also becomes available When you
enter the third level, the Characteristic also becomes available
And when you enter the fourth and last level of a Career, the
Characteristic finally becomes available
The cost in XP of a Characteristic Advance is shown in the
Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs table, and
depends on the number of Characteristic Advances you have
already taken in that Characteristic
Each Characteristic Advance adds +1 to the associated
Characteristic So, if you had purchased 4 Agility Advances,
and your Initial Agility was 27, your Current Agility would be
31 The Advances would cost 25 XP per +1 Advance, as at each
point the number of Advances previously taken would be in the
0–5 range
Chapter 5: Rules explains how the Characteristics are used in the
game, and Chapter 2: Character explains what each Characteristic
is There is no upper limit to the number of Characteristic
Advances that can be purchased, although higher levels do become
prohibitively expensive Note: While Weapon Skill and Ballistic
Skill have the word ‘Skill’ in them, this is only a historical artefact
— they are characteristics and are Advanced as such
Characteristic and Skill

61 to 65 390 320
66 to 70 450 380
70+ 520 440
Skill Advances
You can advance all the Skills listed for your Career level and
lower So, if you were an Apothecary’s Apprentice (level 1), you
could only access the Skills listed under Apothecary’s Apprentice
(level 1) But, if you were a Master Apothecary (level 3), you could
access all the Skills for Master Apothecary (level 3), Apothecary
(level 2), and Apprentice Apothecary (level 1)
The cost in XP of a Skill Advance is shown in the
Characteristic and Skill Improvement XP Costs table, and
depends on the number of Skill Advances you have already
taken in that Skill
Each Skill Advance adds +1 to your Skill level Therefore, if you
had purchased 9 Advances in Stealth and your Agility was 31,
your Stealth would be 40 The first 5 Advances would cost 10
XP each, and the 4 remaining Advances would cost 15 XP each
Note: One of the Skills in the first level of your Career will be
marked in italics This is the Skill you Test when Earning money
(see page 51)
The full rules for how to use your Skills can be found in Chapter
4: Skills and Talents Like Characteristic Advances, there is
no upper limit to the number of Skill Advances that can be
purchased
Cl ass and Careers III

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Non-Career Advances
Characters will inevitably want to advance Characteristics and
Skills not listed in their Careers That’s fine, if the GM feels
it’s appropriate, but it costs double The GM might want you
to find a teacher or otherwise play out this unusual education
Non-Career Characteristic and Skill Advances cost double the
amount of XP listed in the Characteristic and Skill Improvement
XP Costs table
Normally, non-Career Talents may not be purchased with XP,
although Training and Unusual Learning Endeavours in Chapter
6: Between Adventures provide an opportunity to purchase nonCareer
Advances as if they were Career Advances, and give the
possibility of learning non-Career Talents
Talent Advances
Talents are only available when you are in the level of the Career
that lists them So, if you are an Apothecary-General, you can
only buy Talents listed under Apothecary-General, not those
listed under Apprentice Apothecary, Apothecary, or Master
Apothecary
Talents Advances cost 100 XP +100 XP per Advance already
taken in that Talent
The rules for every Talent can be found in Chapter 4: Skills and
Talents The first time you purchase a new Talent (for 100 XP)
it grants you access to the Talent’s special rules If you purchase
a Talent multiple times (second time costs 200 XP, third 300
XP) any additional abilities bestowed are listed in the Talent
description
Note: Not all Talents can be purchased multiple times Check
the Talent listing for any limitations
Changing Career
When you have taken all the Advances you want in your current
Career, it’s time to change Career Changing Career means one
of two things:
1) Moving to a different level within your current Career (from
Apothecary to Master Apothecary); or
2) Moving to an entirely new Career (from Apothecary to
Scholar)
Options:
Customise Your Trappings
The Trappings listed in each Career are guidelines only Feel
free to be creative with your Trappings, choosing those that
fit your interpretation of your character’s Career and how
it manifests So, if you were using the Soldier Career to
represent a grizzled Handgunner from Reikland’s State Army,
you may decide to tweak the required Trappings to include
powder and shot
Trappings are how you are recognised as someone belonging
to your career If you want to go incognito, you might not
want to have all your trappings with you Similarly, if you
are trying to use the authority of your Career, not having the
trappings of such means people might not take you seriously
In each case, you will have to first determine if you have completed
your current Career level If you have, changing Career costs 100
XP If you have not, it costs 200 XP
Completing a Career
Completing a Career represents mastering your current vocation
and being ready to move on to something new To complete a
Career, you must have the number of Advances listed below in all
your Career level’s Characteristics and in eight of your Career level’s
available Skills You must also have at least 1 Talent from your current
Career level Skills and Talents you have gained from advancement
prior to entering your current Career count towards this
Level Advances
1 5
2 10
3 15
4 20
Note: Just because you have completed a Career level does not
mean you have to move to a new one Moving Career is always
entirely up to you If you wish to stay in the first level of Pauper
forever, that’s completely fine
Changing to a New Level
If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter
the next Career level, or any lower Career level, for 100 XP So, if
you completed Hunter (Hunter level 2), you could exit to Tracker
III
48
(Hunter level 3) or Trapper (Hunter level 1) for 100 XP, but not
Huntsmaster (Hunter level 4)
With GM permission, you can also skip Career levels This is
normally driven by in-game events For example: A Scion (Noble
level 1) inherits a significant estate during play, so the GM offers
Noble Lord (Noble level 4) as a potential change of Career Like
normal, changing to this Career level costs 100 XP if you have
completed your current Career level, or 200 XP if you have not
Changing to a New Career
If you have completed your current Career level, you can enter
the first level of any Career from your Class for 100 XP, or for
200 XP if you have not completed your current Career level If
you want to enter the first level of a Career from a different Class,
this cost an extra 100 XP Note: your GM may require in-game
justification for such Career changes; after all, not just anyone can
enter Noble, even if you are in the Courtier Class
Further, if you have completed your current Career level, with
GM permission, and solid justification, you can enter the same
Career level in any Career within your Class So, if you completed
Master Apothecary (Apothecary level 3), you could move to
Fellow (Scholar level 3), to show you were taking a teaching
position in Altdorf University This costs 100 XP However, be
aware there are obvious limitations here Some Careers, such as
Wizard, require the basics be learned before the more advanced
lore can be understood and the Talents of earlier Career levels
will not be open to you at a higher level
Lastly, between adventures, you can also change Career using the
Change Career Endeavour (see page 196)

Alternative Changes
in Career
Sometimes during play you are offered a job in the most
unlikely circumstances For example: a local Baron may
employ you to be his Honour Guard (Guard, Career level 3),
or you may escape Altdorf on the run from the city watch,
now effectively an Outlaw (Outlaw, Career level 2) In such
circumstances, the GM may offer a Career change that lies
outside your normal Career Path That’s not only fine, it’s
recommended, as it’s always more fun to tie your Career
choices into in-game events
Status
Old World society is highly stratified — common folk are in
little doubt as to their place in the society whilst the elite enjoy
power and prestige that is brutally enforced and therefore largely
unchallenged Most people in between are acutely aware of their
standing, and preoccupied with improving it This is represented
by Status, which can modify the interactions between people of
different social classes
Tiers and Standing
Status is expressed as a Tier — from lowest to highest: Brass,
Silver, or Gold — and a Standing — which is a number, generally
from 1–5, showing how respected the character is within their
Tier
If you have a higher Tier than another character, you have higher
Status If you are in the same Tier as another character, then you
are higher Status if you have a higher Standing
The Three Tiers
The most important distinctions in Status are the three Tiers:
The Gold Tier: Reserved for the rulers of society; those who
directly serve them as advisors, protectors, and maintainers of
the law; and the independently wealthy To reach this position
requires hard work, success, and not a little luck All in the Gold
tier are rich, respected, and of higher Status than those in the
Silver and Brass tiers
The Silver Tier: Populated by well-to-do townsfolk and those
following professions requiring skill and expertise Tradesmen,
craftsmen, and merchants make up most of the upper ranks of the
Cl ass and Careers III

tier, whilst the bottom is filled by those providing services These
folk lead relatively humble lives, but they are still respectable
People of the Silver Tier are of higher Status than those of the
Brass Tier
The Brass Tier: Occupied by peasants and those in the poorest
professions which often require no particular skills The Brass
Tier also contains many criminals, ne’er-do-wells, and those who
don’t make any living at all Determining Statu
s
Your Status is determined by your Career level Beside the name
of your Career level is your Status, marked as ‘Brass 3’, ‘Silver
1’, or similar This is the Tier and Standing Should you change
Career, check the new Status by the name of your new Career
Level, and mark it on your Character Sheet Changing Status
Status changes for the following reasons:
1 You change Career
2 You gain a Talent that modifies Status
3 The GM imposes a change in Status due to in-game
events
Whatever causes a change in Status, you should take time to
explain what exactly occurred, and the impact this has on your
character If you have changed to a different Career Level, say
from a Student to a Scholar, what precipitated this? What subject
did you study? And how does your character now feel after
graduating? Taking time to explain your changing circumstances
makes your character more rounded and believable
Beyond the Social
Norm
Status provides a rough guide to how the folk of the
Old
World behave when they fit in with acceptable norms However,
some characters will violate this, and that’s completely fine If
you wish to randomise how an NPC reacts to Social Status,
roll 1d10 on the following table:
1d10 Result
1-2 Defies Status The character defies conven
-
tion concerning Status and ignores its effects
3-8 Standard Reactions The character follows
the Status rules as normal
9-10
Extreme Views The character holds extreme
views Modify all Tests influenced by Status
by a further +/–10, as appropriate
The
Effe
c
t
s of Statu
s
Status influences a number of situations that impact your
Character Often these involve making Tests easier or more
difficult (see page 153) The GM may expand or limit these
influences as they wish
Charm
Status impacts Charm significantly, with those of higher Status
more easily able to get what they want, and those of lower status
III
finding it harder to secure influence In most circumstances, those
of a higher Tier gain a bonus of +10 to Charm Tests influencing
those with a lower tier Similarly, those of lower Tier suffer a
penalty of –10 to influence those of a higher Tier The GM may
also apply these modifiers to those of different Standing in the
same Tier, but this is rarer
If the target of the Charm attempt is atypical, this might not
work as usual however An individual who ‘Defies Status’ would
mean no modifiers apply, and one with ‘Extreme Views’ might
mean that the opposite modifiers apply (–10 rather than +10, for
example)
Options: Begging & Status
Begging is often most effective when aimed at those who are
just above you in the social order
For example: Most Beggars are Brass Tier and therefore
benefit from a +10 bonus when begging from people who are
Silver Tier, instead of suffering a –10 penalty
Entertain
Status does not normally influence Entertain tests However, a
GM ought to consider that some entertainments are thought
fitting to particular venues A peasant playing a hurdy-gurdy
is not likely to go down well at an opera house, whilst even a
mediocre orchestra is likely to draw a significant audience if it
starts performing on the village green
As such the GM might like to consider the sort of audience
a performance is normally aimed at, and the audience that is
actually available, and apply suitable modifiers
Intimidate
If you have a higher Status than the target of your Intimidate, you
typically gain a bonus of +10
Gossip
Gossip tends to be stilted between people of different classes
Any Gossip Test between individuals of different Tiers suffers a
penalty of –10
Leadership
Status plays a very important role in Leadership Indeed, the
State Army normally only grants higher ranks to those of noble
birth
If you are a higher tier than the target of your Leadership Test,
you gain a bonus of +10 If you are two tiers higher, the bonus
increases to +20
Maintaining Status
In order to benefit (or suffer) from Status, you have to act in
accordance with your role in society
It may be that you wish to pass incognito, presenting yourself
anonymously Typically, you will be counted as having a Status of
Brass 3 if you do this
Example: Hans the noble wears the latest fashions and always
buys the best trappings He rides his lovingly groomed horse
into a village, pausing only to let his herald announce his
presence to all He fully benefits from his Gold 2 Status His
brother Heinrich dresses in old clothes, hides all his courtly
garb under the bed, and acts like a nameless wanderer He is
treated as having a Status of Brass 3
Keeping Up Appearances
Characters need to spend a certain amount of money to maintain
their lifestyle As explained in The Cost of Living (see page 289)
there are minimum expectations of expenditure for each Tier
Should a character fail to live up to these levels of expenditure
they will begin to be perceived as being of lower Status, losing 1
point of Standing per week
To stop this decline, the character must resume spending the
money expected of them, whereupon they regain 1 point of
Standing a week until they recover the lost points
Should Standing reach 0, your tier drops by one and your
Standing is set to 5 If you are already at the lowest tier, then your
Status sticks at Brass 0
Example: Pietr is a Noble and has been slumming it in the East
End of Altdorf for the last two weeks, letting his Standing of
Gold 3 drop to Gold 1 as he eats poor food, drinks cheap beer,
and hostels in flop houses Should another week pass and Pietr
does not change his ways, his Standing will drop to Gold 0,
which immediately becomes Silver 5 Should this occur, Pietr’s
father will almost certainly step in to curtail the family shame…
Earning Money with Status
Your Status is directly linked to the amount of money you
earn while working The higher your Status, the more money
you can earn as your good name attracts business If the GM
agrees, during play you can spend a week to work in your Career
assuming you are in a place where such is feasible (it’s hard to
be a Watchman in the middle of a wasteland) This is called
Earning
Cl ass and Careers III
51
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
When Earning, make an Average (+20) Dramatic Test (see
page 152) against the Earning Skill of your Career (the Skill
marked in italics in the Career’s first level) If passed, you receive
the money marked in the table below If failed, you receive half
the money If an Astounding Failure (–6) is scored, you have a
very bad week, and earn nothing (or have your money stolen, or
some similar mishap)
This total is not strictly speaking how much money you earn, it’s
more a representation of how much money you have left at the
end of the week after all your expenses are taken into account
Tier Amount Earned per Standing
Brass 2d10 Brass Pennies
Silver 1d10 Silver Shillings
Gold 1 Gold Crown
Note: This is the same amount of coin earned with an Income
Endeavour (see page 198)
Example: Gunther the Coachman decides he’ll work for
the Four Seasons Coaching House for a week while his peers
research a library for things he frankly doesn’t understand, and
secretly thinks may be heretical if he did The GM agrees to let
Gunther enact some Earning, so Gunther rolls against his Drive
(Coach) skill (his Earning Skill for Coachman) and passes Given
his Status is Silver 2, he can roll 2d10 and earn that much silver
Unfortunately, he only rolls a 1 and a 2 for a total of 3 silver
shillings; clearly Gunther was drinking a lot after his long work
shifts, and has little coin remaining…
Gendered Career Names
Although some Careers have masculine or feminine names
because of the limitations of language, all careers are intended
for any gender; so, no matter how your character identifies, all
careers are available
For example: Anyone may serve any deity Although some
Gods (such as Taal and Ulric, and Rhya and Shallya) are
more likely to have servants who identify with the same gender
as the God, other deities (such as Verena and Sigmar), have
an equal appeal to all
Career Format
The following is a breakdown of the information each Career
presents
	 Name: The name of the Career
	 Limitations: A list of the different Species typically using
the Career
	 Summary: A one-sentence introduction to the Career
	 Description: A paragraph or two describing the career,

	 Advance Scheme: The Career’s Advance Scheme
	 Career Path: The Name, Status, Skills, Talents, and
Trappings for each of the Career’s four levels Note:
if a Talent or Skill is marked ‘(Any)’ it means you
can choose one of the options for that Talent or Skill
when in that Career Level; So, Lore (Any), could be
Lore (Geography), Lore (Folklore), Lore (Magick), or
any other similar example Likewise, if one is marked
(Local), it means you can choose one of the options for
the Talent or Skill drawn from the local area; So, Lore
(Local), could be Lore (Altdorf), Lore (Riverways), Lore
(The Wasteland), or any other similar example

commonly pills, draughts, and ointments — for sale to patients and
doktors alike Their workshops are filled with a dazzling array of
bubbling alembics, overflowing beakers, worn mortar and pestles, and
other physic-making paraphernalia Some Apothecaries supplement
their income selling illicit substances — from stimulants for desperate
students, to hallucinogenic weirdroot for bored nobles or shady
commissions from even shadier groups Supplying these is lucrative,
but also dangerous Rare ingredients are expensive, so Apothecaries
frequently have cash flow problems, and journey the wilds to collect
their own ingredients Many take temporary employment with
expeditions, mercenaries, or the military for extra coin

Due to Physician Guild pressure, most towns ban Apothecaries from
formally practicing medicine, but during play Apothecaries can easily
fill the role of a healer Indeed, they are versatile in this role because
they can also identify dangerous and unusual substances the party
may encounter, and even turn some into useful medicine

‘What will it do? Well, it’s supposed to pluck the chicken, Smallnose

‘Master Engineer Volker von Meinkopt found inspiration watching
students reloading at the Imperial Gunnery School He had a revelation:
more barrels = more shots = more lethality He soon produced the first
repeating handgun, ‘Von Meinkopt’s Whirling Cavalcade of Death’,
and pistol, ‘Von Meinkopt’s Micro-mainspring of Multitudinous
Precipitation of Pernicious Lead’ Not content to rest on those laurels,

You are devoted to the service of your deity, having sworn vows for a
life of service
Nuns are members of religious orders, normally cloistered within an
abbey, convent, or monastery Most rise before the sun for morning
prayer before toiling in fields, tending to the sick, or preserving
important manuscripts Vows of pilgrimage cause some to travel the
Empire, while others take oaths to serve the community, moving
amongst the people, tending to their spiritual needs Devoted
hermits and tenders to shrines are also thought of as ‘Nuns’ or ‘Monks’
by the folk of the Empire Many Nuns learn valuable trades such as
vintners, brewers or calligraphers Abbesses use these activities to
attract donations and patronage from the local nobility Leaders of
particularly large or martial Orders can gather significant influence

Elven practices, the formal science of medicine is relatively new and
not-entirely-trusted Due to the Empire’s history with necromancy
and the safe-guards imposed by the Cult of Morr, studying cadavers
is forbidden, making learning of anatomy hard Medicine’s reputation
suffered further from swindlers selling ‘miracle cure-alls’ that do nothing
or cause actual harm Physicians learn their profession at a university
or while apprenticed to a Guild Physician Most cheap surgery is
undertaken by back-street physicians known as barber-surgeons
whose training is informal Trained doctors with strong stomachs are

Poor Scholars who cannot or will not tutor often need funds to
continue their research A few search the dark corners of the world
for lost secrets and ancient tomes Others are hired to accompany
adventuring expeditions where their knowledge can be put to more
practical use
Scholar is a useful Career, with access to rare Lore skills, a good way
for the GM to share information with players Played with commonsense
they can counter-balance rash and martially-inclined characters’
tendencies to solve every problem with a blade Scholars can use their
knowledge to solve puzzles or come up with unusual strategies and

Feared and distrusted by the citizens of the Empire, you legally wield
powerful and dangerous magic
Wizards channel one of the eight ‘Winds of Magic’ only spellcasters
perceive, to cast potent spells To legally cast magic in the Empire, a
Human must follow the Articles of Imperial Magic and belong to
one of the Eight Colleges of Magic in Altdorf — each dedicated
to a specific wind, as Magisters can only safely channel one After
graduation, Apprentices become Magisters and serve the Empire
Magisters carefully study and practice their art, which, according to
the Articles, they can only use outside their colleges in defence of
their own life, or against the enemies of the Empire Many Magisters
are attached to the Empire State Army, and although they are treated
with cautious suspicion, none can deny their effectiveness on the
battlefield

‘I don’t care what promises they make, or what colleges they belong to,
they are dangerous abominations I am continuing to petition for their
destruction in the name of Sigmar, for the good of us all’
– Reikhardt Mair, Witch Hunter
Many Magisters leave the Colleges of Magic in debt for the cost of their
tuition These Wizards may be keen to find immediate employment, or
seek out their fortune on land, at sea, or anywhere else they might be
able to find relics, artefacts or lost tomes of magical lore Journeying
Magisters, eager to prove themselves, are actively encouraged to test
their skills across the Empire by hunting down whatever dangers
threaten the local populace
Wizards are excellent characters to add some firepower to a group,
but it can be intimidating for new players to have to learn a whole
additional set of rules for spells Because of this the GM should be
aware that they might initially need some extra support to ensure that
they are using these rules effectively and to the group’s best advantage

Dwarfs interested in maintaining established traditions The most
dangerous Agitators have destabilised the rule of nobles, towns,
and even entire provinces Pamphleteers nail signs to billboards, or
distribute them in market squares, though often those they seek to
reach cannot read
Religious Agitators can make a good living as street preachers,
receiving donations from pious devotees and attracting flagellants and
zealots as followers Agitators who survive long enough to become

authorities They may become leaders of motley groups of the restless
and disaffected, exhorting — or even extorting — them to fight for
a greater cause
Altdorf has a legendary reputation for deep fogs and riots Perhaps
this happens because Altdorf is the Imperial Capital, or maybe its
because the Grey College draws swathes of treacherous Ulgu, the
Grey Wind of Magic, to the city Whatever the case, it seems that
whenever the fog draws in from the Altdorf Flats, mobs rise in the
streets, and woe betide any watchmen who try to silence their right
to be heard

A skilled craftsperson, you take pride in your work, creating products
for sale and commission
Artisans produce goods, ranging from everyday necessities sold by
Bakers and Chandlers, to weapons and riverboats crafted by Smiths
and Shipwrights The Empire’s larger towns and cities have guilds
to protect local Artisans from fraudsters, as an Artisan’s entire
livelihood can be jeopardised by unskilled competitors hawking
cheap low-quality merchandise Guild Artisans observe strict
quality standards, with those failing to meet them blackballed and
forbidden to trade locally
Artisans work at all levels of society not just producing goods, but
also repairing them They are employed by navies to maintain vessels,
by armies to manage war machines and siegeworks, and by merchant
houses of all sizes to transform raw materials into sellable goods

– Frau Glasmeister, Glassblowers’ Guildmaster
Artisans in training can be sent to practice under other masters
The constant pressure to achieve perfection is so stifling that young
Artisans sometimes take a break to pursue more liberating enterprises,
sometimes supporting the army or navy
Dwarf Guilds don’t usually admit Humans, and Dwarfs are traditionally
allowed to practice their trade in Imperial cities without joining a local
Guild This can cause conflict as the Guilds are rarely pleased with
skilled competition Halflings are not so particular, and most will
happily join Human Guilds (if admitted) and allow Humans to join
their Guilds Elves do not have Artisan’s Guilds, and though they could
join one it is unlikely they would lower themselves to do so

and scraps scavenged from the mud and detritus of city life, though
posturing dandies will happily dispose of a few pfennigs to make
them go away The law affords them little protection and the watch
has no sympathy for loiterers
Paupers often land on the streets as orphans and have been in and out
of Mercy Houses all their lives Once the basic skills of scrounging
and panhandling are learned, Beggars can advance their techniques
using disguises and sympathy ploys Other Paupers are not destitute
but simply employed in some of the worst occupations, on the lowest
rung of the social ladder, like Gong Farmers, Bone Pickers, and Rag
and Bone Men

my example’
– ‘The Kaiser’, Altdorf Beggar-King
The only direction from rock-bottom is upward Some Beggars will
eagerly leave the gutter behind for adventuring opportunities, so
long as they aren’t being exploited as battle-fodder Those unable to
afford a porter might hire a Beggar instead, and a Beggar’s savvy is
useful when penniless and hungry And, if it all goes wrong, it’s easy
to return to the begging life

deductive reasoning and — if necessary — breaking

investigators — most commonly serving Sigmar and Verena —
follow stricter ethical codes
Some experienced Investigators cultivate matter-of-fact airs of

Dwarf gromril or Eastern spices command higher profits, but risk
longer transport routes and require strong foreign contacts Merchants
cannot sell in most towns without approval from (and payments to) a
Merchants’ Guild, powerful institutions rivalling the noble courts in
political influence Local commerce is managed by Traders who ship
goods between backwater villages and nearby towns
Traders can join guilds by apprenticing under Master Merchants

warehouses and sales offices in multiple cities enjoy the same status as
minor nobles In addition to trading, some Merchants also branch out

clever’, or when competition becomes fierce When journeying, they
may befriend those who welcome help from a streetwise slinger, and
Rat Catchers are willing to venture into places normal people won’t
If you want to play a character who may be aware of the ‘too big’ and
‘too clever’ Skaven (see page 336), Rat Catcher is for you However,
the Skaven frequently assassinate any who spread rumours of their
existence Because of this, wise Ratcatchers are unlikely to admit what
they know, some even using their professional opinion to actively

Artist
Dwarf, Halfling, High Elf, Human, Wood Elf
You possess an artistic gift, one that transcends daily life and uplifts
the souls of others
Artists use their talents — for painting, sculpting, writing and similar
— to create works of fine art Often their careers begin as Apprentices
to experienced Master Artists, though some are simply prodigies The
best can attract a patron, and some end up teaching, forming their
own schools of art and attracting the wealthiest of benefactors to their
fashionable salons
Sadly, most Artists spend their lives in a vain attempt to prove their
value to a society that rarely appreciates them Some make ends
meet through different means: satirising nobles and politicians in
cartoons for the Altdorf broadsheets, sketching suspects for watch
captains, writing social commentary, or even forging the work of more
renowned artists

‘Please remain still, my lord It is rather difficult to capture the majesty

you find your incessant squirming as bothersome as I do’

Your blade is an instrument of justice, bound by long tradition and

Duellists fight on behalf of others — settling matters of honour
between organisations or individuals — or as surrogates for the law,
representing the accused or the accuser in trials by combat For some
Duellists the act of fighting is reward enough for the considerable
risks they face Training is dangerous, leaving some apprentices
crippled or scarred for life Those who live long enough to learn from
their mistakes can aspire to the fame of a Blademaster, teaching their
techniques to eager students Judicial Champions duel on behalf of
governments and nobles, and their blades can determine the fates
of nations Some modern Duellists, especially hot-headed Altdorf
students, favour pistols This is regarded by the older generation as
dishonourable and foolhardy

Both inexperienced and esteemed Duellists alike travel the Empire
in search of opponents with which to bolster their reputations For
others, the hunt for a veteran instructor drives them to explore
the furthest flung of the Old World’s locales Masters of foreign
techniques are also sought by Duellists who wish to add unique styles
of fighting to their repertoires As skilled combatants, Duellists often
augment their livelihood with mercenary work, even acting as guards
for caravans and riverboats in a pinch Although Dwarfs have no
interest in fencing with flimsy swords and the frippery of the duelling
scene, they have long traditions of using combat to resolve bitter
disputes, and will travel far to enhance their skills

The blood of highborn ancestors courses through the veins of the
nobility, granting Nobles the power to rule, make laws, and dispense
justice Nobles often inherit vast wealth and holdings, although only
those with a direct line of succession can expect to wield any genuine
power Many spend their lives consolidating this wealth and power
through business, politics, and conquest Those without substantial
inheritance must make their own way in the world, joining the State
Army or navy as a commissioned officer, or commit to service of one
of the gods It is common to find Nobles working for more powerful
noble houses, such as sending their daughters to serve as hand maidens
to royalty

Many Nobles serve their families abroad in the hopes they can advance
their station and earn acclaim amongst their peers Others, bored by
pampered living, search for excitement as adventurers and would-be
heroes Scions with few prospects sometimes seek their fortunes far
from courtly intrigue and betrayal, taking up other occupations to
expand their options

escape the beleaguered masses tending the fields Servants are taught
comportment along with the skills necessary to cook, clean, buttle,
and groom on behalf of their betters They are provided with room,
board, and a wage, but the quality of a Servant’s life depends on how
well treated they are Some Servants dress their employer, cook or
serve meals, manage stores of wine and other consumables, or tend
to the grounds
Experienced Servants can aspire to the role of personal Attendant, or

even years, cultivating an unremarkable identity with ties to one or
more groups or individuals Their actions are risky If caught, Spies are
rarely executed quickly and often tortured at length Many Informers
are forced into spying via blackmail or other threats A skilled Spy will
earn well, but extrication from such activities can be more perilous than
the activities themselves Given Spies avoid undue attention, they aren’t
typically known by their reputations unless those reputations are as
anonymous as they are

of a grand estate, overseeing a lord’s hunting grounds, or caring for
a rarely-visited holidaying home Wardens might keep watch over
forested or agricultural lands, or see to the maintenance of lakes, rivers,

it makes them feel safer than having to explain the river is home to an

A Hedge Witch is often the first to notice supernatural foul play
The subsequent investigations often lead to all sorts of dangers and
adventure When Witch Hunters come to town, Hedge Witches often
take a leave of absence, lying low or travelling elsewhere until danger
is passed
The Hedgefolk are known by many names across the Empire, but have
one thing in common: the goal of preserving their ancient traditions
from destruction Hedge Witches have little love for the Colleges of
Magic, knowing any child taken by them will likely never return to
serve their community, instead pressed into service in some far-off

sicknesses Herbalists dedicate time to visiting the sick, diagnosing their

the illicit substances they offer Although an untrue stereotype, it’s a

‘My lord, those tracks… we’re not following a stag There are Turnskins

– Gundred Maynir, Huntsmaster
‘Are you trying to tell me hunting’s not a sport because both sides
don’t know they’re playing? Might I suggest you’d been hunting the
wrong game’
– Graf Bernard Leutze von Holthausen
A common punishment for hunter caught poaching is to lose two
fingers Faced with being unable to draw a bow, many will cut and run
before the punishment can be administered, preferring to take a chance
in the forests Around the fertile villages of the Suden Vorbergland,
Hunters are losing ground to farmers as the trees are cut back and
nobles reserve what hunting is left for sport The Imperial Army is
always on the lookout for reliable, local hunters to support their army
as they march, acting as support archers or scouts A life of adventure
awaits any Hunter willing to take the Emperor’s Shilling

Miner
Dwarf, Halfling, Human
A hewer of stone, you pursue back-breaking work in the darkest
depths of the world
Many prospectors are tempted by stories of gold in the Skaag
Hills, but real mining is hard work down dark, dangerous tunnels
Adept at constructing supports and assessing mineral ores for their
value, Miners are alert to unexpected dangers from explosive gas to
tunnelling Greenskins, and are notoriously tough, both physically and
mentally Prospectors usually work on commission, with a license to
prospect in return for sharing finds with the local lord Some noble
houses’ fortunes are built on the rich mines in their lands, and often
Miners in these pits will be criminals or debtors pressed into service
Quarrymen hewing open-face stone ostensibly have a safer job than
those underground, but accidents are common and Beastman attack
from the forest is an ever-present danger

sixteen tons added, you made…let me see… no, you actually owe us
two for today Another day older and deeper in debt, boy’
– Frederika, Victualler of the Delfgruber Minehead
Many independent Miners find themselves thrust into peril when set
upon by Goblins or other subterranean horrors Some find the rewards
of this life more lucrative, if not less dangerous, than slaving away for
a mine owner for a pittance Prospectors have many opportunities
for adventure and can easily pull together a band of like-minded folk
eager for riches and glory
To Dwarfs, mining is not an occupation limited to commoners
Rather, they are considered artisans of great skill and are wellrespected
amongst the Dawi Possessed of a keen sense for stone,
Dwarfs are drawn to valuable seams and seemingly have a sixth-sense
for when to shore up passages Some Dwarf clans hold such pride in
their mining ability that they march to war armed with picks rather
than axes

You have a talent for divining the future, or for convincing others you
can…
Searching for meaning in a dangerous world, people turn to Mystics
for a glimpse of their future Wandering caravans of Strigany are a
common sight in Reikland, and locals scrape together coin to hear their
fortune, and buy charms and love potions Most Mystics are perceptive
and intuitive, able to divine their customers’ hopes and fears and give
readings just specific enough to be believable Mystics must be careful,
and walk a fine line between accusations of trickery and heretical
witchery Mystics demonstrate their talent in a wide variety of ways:
palmists and card readers are common amongst the Strigany, while a
Wood Elf is more likely to interpret the signs and symbols to be found
around them in nature, or to be inspired by dreams and visions Many
cults also have their own Seers and Sages, each prophesising the future
through the paradigm of their beliefs

best places to forage Experienced Scouts will barely be seen by their
employers as they explore the trails ahead and keep a watchful eye
out for hidden dangers While most Scouts keep to familiar territory,
some specialise in safely navigating unmapped terrain Explorers might
venture even further into treacherous and hostile territory, filling in
the blank spaces on their maps Most Scouts do not tackle dangers
themselves, preferring to slip away quietly to warn their companions

The pastoral safety of a sheltered village is an unspeakable bore for
some young Villagers who listen avidly to the tales of faraway lands
Of course, the stories they hear from wandering Pedlars and Strigany,
all fuelling schemes to escape, bear little relation to the harsh reality
of Empire life During winter, when food is short, and the fields do

are legally appointed by provincial courts and receive warrant papers
granting licence to seize or sometimes kill the target While some are
motivated by Verena’s justice, most are more concerned by the rewards,
often finding the ‘dead’ in ‘dead or alive’ to be the most convenient route
to their fortune Many Bounty Hunters start as Thief-Takers, those
hired by crime victims to retrieve stolen goods Over time, those with
an established reputation may find permanent work from a merchant or
noble house, guild, or cult, or may build a company of Bounty Hunters,
working as a group to collect the largest rewards

Beastmen and other dangers that threaten the Empire’s highways The
Wardens are supported by a system of tolls, taxes they often collect
personally Successful Road Wardens are well-received and respected,
and often have bunks in each inn along their route Most mainroad
Road Wardens are part of the State Army, patrolling primary
thoroughfares during peace time, so are well-trained and resplendent
in neat uniforms Less-travelled roads make do with local equivalents,
some of whom take advantage of their position and lack of supervision
for their own gain Some Wardens prefer sitting in their safe, fortified
toll stations to clearing the roads, but travellers often balk at handing
over coin when the roads are dangerous and in disrepair

happening in the countryside is often close to a well-patrolled
roadside When trouble occurs, Road Wardens are summoned to
resolve any problems If they follow up and become involved in an
investigation, they are simply doing their job, and might even secure
extra pay for their time, even if the resulting adventure takes them far

You hunt the illegal witches plaguing the Empire by any and all

There are few so feared and respected as the Witch Hunter, and they
are given extraordinary leeway in performing their duties Typically
armed with silvered blades and a brace of pistols — for lead is not
so easily dispelled — they stalk all corners of the Old World ready to
dispense judgement on any witch they find, or any who would harbour
them Most Witch Hunters in the Empire are attached to the Cult of
Sigmar Secular Witch Hunters are sometimes employed by provincial
government, though these are little more than specialist bounty hunters
The Colleges of Magic also have Witch Hunters called Magisters
Vigilant who pursue rogue wizards, necromancers, and daemonologists
— they believe it is wisest to set a witch to catch a witch

upon whenever the foul influence of unsanctioned magic emerges,
and are expected to hunt it down The bigger the reputation a Witch
Hunter earns, the more dangerous the foes assigned, and the greater

knowledge of their rivers A Boat-hand is the dogsbody, but will learn
the ropes swiftly Boatmen crew merchant barges carrying cargo to and
from markets, either working for themselves or for a larger Merchant

A boatman will not need to seek out adventure, for more than likely
adventure will come to them Boats are useful to nearly everyone,
and therefore useful to almost any adventure plot; they also make an
excellent base of operations Boatmen will not need to worry about
following investigation and adventure if the plot stays on or close to
the river Even if the plot leaves the river, they could still easily allow a

Huffers are specialist river guides with expert knowledge of local river
systems They are a common sight near the most dangerous stretches of
the Empire’s rivers and can command significant wages for what many
view as easy work Others view it as cheap compared to the potential
cost of lost cargo
Many Huffers specialise in a single, notorious stretch of water, while
others make their money at certain times of the year when the waters
are at their worst Other Huffers have broader knowledge and will
guide vessels for their entire journey, effectively acting as navigators
This is especially true of merchant ships with particularly valuable cargo

‘A great big ship came in from Marienburg, low in the water and

take them through the Furdienst Steep, yes, but it was a big ship
The arrogant Wastelander scoffed, said he’d do it himself But sure
enough, they drifted right into the shallows and were holed They
lost a good part of their cargo and it took them a week to repair the
damage Reckon it cost them a bit more than a crown’
– Ilsa Dasche, Huffer
As an expert for hire, Huffers are often hired by wealthy patrons,
frequently brought in as specialists on journeys of discovery Even
when travelling into the unknown, Huffers are useful for their broad
range of knowledge concerning river conditions and piloting Because
of the regional and seasonal nature of the work, many Huffers are
ready to drop everything and travel to where they’re needed This
freedom transfers well to the adventuring lifestyle, and also suits
those seeking to return to Huffing should adventuring not supply
their needs

Riverwarden
Halfling, Human
Strong-backed and sure, you patrol the riverways in pursuit of
lawbreakers and troublemakers
A clarion call across the waterways heralds the arrival of the Imperial
River Patrol, a river-borne police force known as much for its harassing
thugs as for its good work Most riverside villages and inns set aside
moorings for them as, without them, worse criminals would rule
the waters The overworked patrols concentrate on egregious crimes,
resolving petty misdemeanours with spot fines On major trade-routes,
the patrols have larger vessels manned by ‘Shipswords’ trained to tackle
larger threats like Greenskins or Trolls
Some Riverwardens rarely see the water, instead manning remote
outposts overlooking strategically important waters Others crew fast
riverboats charged to intercept smugglers in the night The largest
Riverwarden vessels are effectively sea-worthy warships, bristling with
cannon and mortars, ready for almost any eventuality

my honesty? Nah, Big Willi came round and beat me up, and the next

weren’t they?’
– Nikki Schnelling, ex-riverwarden
A diligent Riverwarden, searching vessels and following up leads,
might stumble across any sort of nefarious plot or sinister cargo
Riverwardens typically work month-long shifts, but this means they
also have months off This structure is ideal for adventuring: as a
Riverwarden need not desert their post to pursue private matters, or
even have to persuade their Sergeant that it is their duty to follow up
crimes They can head off, investigate, and be back long before their

Riverwoman
Dwarf, Halfling, Human
Rivers carry most of the Old World’s traffic, and you stand in the
heart of that excitement
The fertile banks of the great rivers of the Empire are densely
populated, and the folk working day-in, day-out in the nearby waters
and marshes provide much of the fresh fish, eels, and crustaceans
feeding the towns and cities Unlike the inland villages, those on
the great rivers frequently receive outsiders who trade and restock,
meaning Riverwomen are somewhat more open and diverse, and
often the first with news from distant lands There are any number of
diverse jobs supported by the river Many harvest the Reik’s bounty:
fisherfolk (using rod, spear, or net), eelers (using traps or pots), or
diggers for shellfish Many live in riverside villages labouring,
dredging, or lugging, and maintaining the Reik’s many thousands of
vessels

Merchant houses The Reikland may have no coast, but the River Reik
from the Wasteland to Altdorf is miles wide and full of ocean-going
vessels The Imperial First Fleet that patrols these waters rarely sees
the open sea, because the taxes to pass warships through Marienburg
are exorbitantly high
Seamen can always find work, whether as cabin staff on an Imperial
battleship or on the crew of a small trading sloop Some Seamen
travel the world by working to pay their passage The Reik also houses
many ‘Missions’, buildings provided by the Imperial Navy for their
staff, many of which employ Seamen

bandits and protection rackets Smugglers see themselves as charitable

flexible Riverwardens take a cut, outlaws are avoided, and more besides
It takes experience and ingenuity to circumvent all the bailiffs, custom
officials, excisemen, and busy bodies keen to stop them, but Smugglers
dare the risks to support themselves and their families
Smugglers come in many forms, perhaps transporting tiny, highvalue
goods for nobles, or large cargoes for shady merchants Some

Charlatan
Halfling, High Elf, Human
Unscrupulous and charming, you separate fools from their money;
thankfully, there is no shortage of fools…
A Charlatan traffics in trust, yet profits from treachery By preying on
emotions and psychological weaknesses, Charlatans offer their ‘mark’ a
prize that is too good to be true Social privilege provides no protection,
and even the loftiest citizens can fall victim to a skilled Charlatan In
addition to a knack for lying, a lack of conscience is also of benefit to
Charlatans
Charlatans include Swindlers, Con Artists, Gamblers, and other
Scoundrels seeking to prey on the gullible Halflings often operate
distraction cons in small family groups Young High Elves, slumming it
with Humans, treat their cons as one big game, not motivated by profit,
but to prove their superiority Some experienced Charlatans work with
artists, who forge documentation for a cut of any profits

fifth ‘heir’ to call this afternoon! How much did you pay for that scrap

– Gerold Behn, Irritated Butler
To avoid rousing suspicion, Charlatans rarely stay in one area for
long Few Swindlers openly admit to their calling, preferring instead
to masquerade as anyone other than themselves Because of this, there
is little stopping Charlatans from pursuing side-matters of interests;
equally, afterwards, they can return to grafting anywhere with rich
fools willing to part with coin on naught but a promise

Dwarf, Halfling, Human
A shrewd assessor of valuables, you’ll buy anything, legal or not, and
turn it around for a tidy profit
A Fence buys thieves’ spoils and sells it on for profit, often to those
unaware the goods are stolen Successful Fences sometimes operate as
pawn brokers, importers, or other merchants Others prefer to remain
mobile, trafficking only in portable items Though the average Fence
deals in goods and valuables, there are also well-informed specialists
who focus on information and forbidden knowledge Some Fences
move stolen items across the Empire A painting stolen in Altdorf is
easier to sell in Talabheim to an audience unaware of the theft When
high profile items vanish, Fences are also the first individuals to be
consulted by those looking to acquire them Some Fences even take
commissions from clients, connecting them with those who can steal
to order

de-fence from being caught, innit So, you go thief, and I’ll make sure
you don’t have to worry about how to shift the merchandise Think of
me like your partner-in-crime’
– ‘Boil’ Vakram, Fence
The search for buyers and sellers, or the need to escape a terrible
situation, can take a Fence anywhere They can be found across the
Empire and in many regions beyond its borders Up-and-coming
Brokers transport illicit goods between Old World cities in search
of buyers Others, looking to make a name for themselves elsewhere,
attempt to make their own niches in existing city underworlds
Given that their interests often collide, Fences and merchants make
occasional bedfellows, as well With all of this criminal activity and

You brave the threat of necromancy, stealing from the dead to line

Trafficking in bodies and body parts is lucrative, with high demand from
universities and physicians for fresh cadavers As well as the scholarly
market, corpses sometimes interred with all manner of valuables can be
found beneath the ravenstones in the tombs of Morr’s Gardens Because
their labours are obvious, illegal, and sacrilegious, Grave Robbers
usually work under cover of darkness Body Snatchers have been known
to cut out the middle man and take beggars or other unfortunates
straight off the streets Tomb Robbers avoid the legal dangers of looting
the recently dead, and instead journey to ancient ruins and barrows,
risking the restless dead and brigands alike Peculiarly, some successful
Treasure Hunters find themselves celebrated as heroes, their treasures
sold to, and displayed by, the aristocracy It’s even rumoured that the
great wealth of one of the Knightly Orders came from a group of their
members plundering a foreign tomb

their prey, some claim to protect the common man These do-gooders

the promise of easy wealth is an allure countless fools are unable to
ignore The more organised the graft, the larger and more complex the

feuds between such illicit organisations have been known to last for
years or even decades The lowliest Thieves target individuals, picking
pockets or waylaying victims in rat-infested alleyways Burglars avoid
confrontation by breaking into businesses and residences, carrying off
portable valuables More ambitious thieves scope out their targets for
days or weeks, even going so far as to infiltrate their target locations
to get a more precise lay of the land Working with other professional
burglars, such experts can organise heists of which their lesser peers can

have such understanding, and I refuse to become a slave to the socalled
Colleges’
– Apprentice Franz Zimmel of the Gold Order,
3 months before being captured by a Witch Hunter
Witches lead dangerous lives Though some pose as Magisters, such
deceptions are easily discerned by anyone with any knowledge of
magic Nevertheless, bands of adventurers — especially those without
unwavering faith or moral qualms — rarely care for the specifics of a
Witch’s education so long as the methods used are effective and have
no truck with the Dark Gods Although unsanctioned witchery is
illegal — carrying the death penalty — most Magisters have a brief
experience as a Witch before entering the Colleges of Magic This
is acknowledged by both the Colleges and the cults, so a Witch, if
discovered, should submit to the authorities Training in the Colleges
could be covered as time between adventures, meaning the Witch
can return at a later date in the Wizard career, or it could become the
focus of a new adventure

personally pursue, they will require permission from senior officers,
perhaps buy out their commission if they have one, or go absent

when they are required to spring into action The best can command

the Imperial palace down to bouncers who stand outside taverns all
night, ready to throw drunkards into the street They also include grave

watchful for grave robbers — and temple guards who defend holy sites
and important priests Merchants often employ many Guards to defend
their valuable stock Some claim bodyguards have it best because they
stay close to their esteemed employers, and often partake of a life far

Empire, the most famous including the Reiksguard, the White Wolves,
the Knights Panther, and the Knights Griffon, each of which have
their own gloried history and mighty heroes Most Empire Knights
belong to secular knightly orders, partly because training heavy lancers
is too prohibitively expensive for most nobles The templar orders,
those dedicated to the service of a single deity are just as common but
are somewhat more independent Alongside these are an uncounted
number of free-lances, mercenary knights, and disgraced knights, most
of whom sell their lance to the highest bidder

‘The knight demanded I get out of his way “Why?” I asked “I am in
the service of the people,” he replied “Well, I’m the people,” I said, “so
I don’t have to get out of your way” He didn’t have an answer to that,
of course So he punched me in the face!’
– Holger Kass, 1st Bögenhafen Halberdiers
‘Lady Myrmaelia Jaeke is the finest knight in the Order of the

Knights might be asked to venture out to fulfil a duty on behalf of
their Order or be sought out by nobles and employed to accompany
a restless heir around the Empire Similarly, templars will have
responsibility to do their god’s will All of these provide perfect
opportunities for Knights looking to adventure By comparison, a
free-lance is just that, and a life of adventure is what they follow by

Pit Fighter

You fight for money, for glory, and for the entertainment of the
masses
Watching fights is a popular pastime In the cities, organised fights
take place every night There is money to be made charging spectators,
and even more in gambling on the result Winners earn coin and are
celebrated as local heroes Losers are hurt or killed Because pit fighting
is officially frowned upon, the fights are often controlled by criminal
gangs, but the rich love to slum it on occasion, especially if it involves
a little bloodshed The gladiators of Tilea are the most renowned pit
fighters, though the chain-fighters of Marienburg and bear-wrestlers of
Kislev draw a crowd Pugilists and wrestlers might work a travelling fair,
challenging the public to survive three minutes in the ring with them,
or they might fight a celebrated opponent in front of cheering crowds
Knives, clubs, chains, boxing, wrestling, there is an almost endless
variation of styles and codes a Pit Fighter might adopt

A strong-arm for hire, you bully, fight, and maybe even kill for coin
Protagonists live by their wits and their muscles and are not generally
fussy about the sort of work they take on A merchant might want to
frighten their business rival An employer might decide his workers
need a bit of encouragement to get a job done quicker A noble might
want his daughter’s no-good suitor to be frightened off Protagonists
are the ones they turn to, and those with the worst reputation get the
best jobs A Protagonist could be the brute in the local bar everyone
knows will bully for coin, or with the reputation for unflinching
violence Some Protagonists have their own code of what they will or
won’t do; others care for nothing but the coin Some are simple bullies
who resort to picking arguments and fights with likely looking targets
to see if they can score any money from the situation

they’re always up for a fight But they will usually expect to get

guarantee of payment is a question they will need to ask themselves
Could a hardened protagonist find a cause they will voluntarily
pursue? Perhaps they could even turn over a new leaf?

Slayer
Dwarf
You are rage and shame incarnate, seeking a worthy death to reclaim
your lost honour
When Dwarfs suffer an unacceptable shame and lose their honour, they
take the Slayer’s Oath and walk the path of Grimnir, their ancestral
god of warriors Covering their bodies in tattoos, shaving the sides of
their head, dying their remaining hair a brilliant orange, and spiking it
with animal grease, they set off into the world, axe in hand, seeking a
glorious death
Slayers wander the Old World hunting deadly beasts, such as Trolls,
Giants, or Dragons Because of the shame they carry, many suffer from
bouts of depression, glutting themselves on food, alcohol, or stronger
stimulants The more foes Slayers face and survive, the more dangerous
and crazed they become, hunting progressively deadlier creatures in the
hopes of finding something that can kill them

Till they fall in battle, a Slayer’s life is one of adventure — they
seek out opportunities to face powerful foes in battle Slayers will
occasionally take other odd jobs, for drinking money or to finance
their travels, but will seek death along the way All Slayers previously
had a life and a career, so there is more to them than simply being a
warrior with a deathwish

You bring divinity to the thick of battle, slaying the enemies of the

Some cults of the Empire have clerics trained for war In the Reikland,
the Warrior Priests of Sigmar are the most common example of
this, and most armies of the Empire are accompanied by hammerbearing
priests encouraging the soldiers in the name of Sigmar But
other cults, especially those of Myrmidia, Ulric, Taal, and Morr, have
Warrior Priests of their own, each with their unique views as to how
war should be conducted Away from the battlefield, Warrior Priests
are also expected to administer to soldiers’ spiritual wellbeing, as well as
making sure morale stays high and discipline is ordered Some orders
of Warrior Priests swear oaths to roam the Empire, seeking heresy
wherever it lies, helping where they can Others prefer not to join
armies, but lead them…

ski lls and talents
‘Sure, playing Scarlet Empress is 90% luck and 10% skill But try
playing without that 10%, and you’ll lose every time’
– Hermann Graumann, Gambler, Raconteur and Liar
During the game, you’ll find yourself in all sorts of situations
where the outcome your Character’s action is uncertain Will
you jump the ravine or plunge to your death? Will you charm
the officious courtier, or will the guards be summoned to deal
with you? How well you perform these actions is determined
by your Skills and Talents In general, Skills describe the
capabilities of your Character, and Talents are special abilities
or tricks you’ve learned If you want to know how they all work
in practice, refer to Chapter 5: Rules
Skills
Where Characteristics represent the raw potential of your body
and mind, Skills represent specific areas of training, knowledge,
experience Each Advance you take in a Skill improves the odds
of succeeding with appropriate tasks — Characters who are well
trained or experienced may be able to best opponents who are
more naturally gifted
Determining your Skill Level
All Skills are associated with a single Characteristic, noted in
the Skill’s description A Skill’s rating is determined by taking
its associated Characteristic and adding the number of Advances
taken in the Skill Space for recording your Advances for each
Skill is provided on your Character Sheet
Example: Sigrid has a Fellowship of 41 and has taken 5 Advances
in Charm, so her Charm is 46 (41+5=46)
Basic and Advanced Skills
Skills are classified as either Basic or Advanced
Basic Skills represent innate or common abilities that you might
practice in day-to-day life Basic Skills can be Tested even if you
have taken no Advances in them To do this, simply attempt a Test
using the Characteristic associated with the Skill as described in
Chapter 5: Rules
Example: Sigrid has no Advances in Athletics However, as
Athletics is a Basic Skill, she can still Test Athletics using the
Characteristic associated with it: Agility
 
ski l ls and talents IV
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Advanced Skills require specialist knowledge, training, or firsthand
experience to even attempt to use You may only Test an
Advanced Skill if you have taken at least one Advance in it If you
have not, you cannot attempt to Test the Skill So, no matter how
intelligent you are, you will not understand the finer points of law
without the Lore (Law) Skill
Example: Adhemar has an Intelligence of 36 and no Advances in
either the Basic Gamble Skill or the Advanced Heal Skill, both
based on Intelligence He can Test the Gamble Skill at 36% as
it is Basic, and anyone can Test Basic Skills The Heal Skill is an
Advanced Skill, so Adhemar has no idea how to patch up wounds
beyond screaming loudly for a doctor!
Grouped Skills and Specialisation
Some Skills are classified as Grouped This means the Skill is an
array of related Skills under one heading Each related Skill is
called a Specialisation When a Specialisation is mentioned in
the rules, it is marked in brackets
Example: Language is a Grouped Skill, thus represents many
related Language Skills under a single Skill heading Examples
of the different Specialisations of Language are: Language
(Bretonnian), Language (Magick), or Language (Mootish)
When you gain an Advance in a Grouped Skill, you must allocate
the Advance to an appropriate Specialisation Sometimes the
Specialisation options will be marked clearly in your Career, so you
simply select one of the options on offer In other cases — such as
when a Specialisation is marked as ‘Any’, meaning you can choose
one Specialisation — you will need to select a Specialisation
yourself; should this be required, either refer to the relevant Skill
description and choose from the sample Specialisations found
there, or, with GM permission, create a unique Specialisation
that fits the Skill and best suits your character
Example: Theodora has a choice of Lore (Any) in her career
When she allocates an Advance to that option, she has to decide
which Lore Specialisation to take After some deliberation, she
chooses to advance her Lore (Theology), showing she has learned
something of the Gods
Other than that, Grouped Skills are handled in exactly the same
way as normal Skills, with each Specialisation handled like a
unique Skill
Example: Sigrid has 8 Advances in the Basic Skill, Entertain
(Singing), but nothing in Entertain (Acting) This means she
Tests her Fellowship of 41 when attempting to act, and Tests 49
when singing (41+8=49) By comparison, Theodora has a single
Advance in the Advanced Skill Animal Training (Pigeons), but
no Advances in Animal Training (Horses) This means she can
use the Skill to train her pigeons to drop bombs on unsuspecting
enemies, but she cannot train her horse to do the same, as she has
no idea how to train horses

Master Skill List
Animal Care (Int) advanced
The Animal Care Skill lets you tend and care for animals, and
heal them should they fall sick or become wounded
Having a single Advance in Animal Care means you can keep
animals healthy without needing to Test You can also enact an
Animal Care Test to identify and resolve problems with animals,
such as:
	 Spotting an illness
	 Understanding reasons for fractiousness or discomfort
	 Determining the quality of the animal
	 Heal Intelligence Bonus + SL Wounds (Note: an animal
can only benefit from one healing roll after each encounter)
	 Staunching a Bleeding condition
	 Preparing the animal for display
In combat, you may appraise an enemy animal with an Animal
Care Test If successful, you and all you inform gain +10 to hit
IV
118
when attacking that animal — or anyone using it as a mount
— until the end of your next turn, as you point out loose tack, a
limp from a niggling wound, or highlight some other weakness
or vulnerability Animal Care may only provide a maximum of
+10 to hit per animal, no matter how many Tests are made to
spot weaknesses
Animals
Whether a creature does, or does not come under the auspices
of Animal Care and Animal Training is up to your GM While
certain creatures — Dog, Horse, Demigryph — seem obvious,
others are less so You may argue that Dragon should be covered
under Animal Training, but try telling that to the Dragon…
Animal Training (Int) advanced, grouped
Animal Training represents your understanding of a particular
type of animal, and your ability to train them A successful use of
the Skill allows you to identify the Trained abilities possessed by
an animal belonging to your Specialisation (see page 118) The
Animal Training Skill also allows you to undertake the Animal
Training Endeavour between adventures (see page 196)
In combat, a successful Opposed Animal Training/Willpower
Test allows you to intimidate a single animal belonging to your
Specialisation; you cause Fear in the animal targeted until the end
of your next turn (see page 190) When causing Fear in this way,
you may subsequently use your Animal Training Skill instead
of Melee when defending against your target; with your GM’s
approval you may also use Animal Training to attack your target,
issuing specific commands
Example: Facing a slavering war-hound, Ilse passes an Opposed
Animal Training (Dog) roll, in the first round of combat, causing
Fear in the beast, and gaining +1 Advantage In the next round
she ‘attacks’ her target with her Animal Training Skill, beating the
dog’s defence Her GM allows her to instruct the beast to flee,
which it does, its tail between its legs
Specialisations: Demigryph, Dog, Horse, Pegasus, Pigeon
Art (Dex) basic, grouped
Create works of art in your chosen medium
Not having access to appropriate Trade Tools will incur a penalty
to your Test The SL achieved determines the quality of the final
piece For complicated or large works of art, an Extended Test
may be required The Art Skill has little use in combat, but marble
busts make marvellous improvised weapons
Example: Irina has been commissioned to paint a portrait
of a local noble, whose favour her party is currying Her GM
determines this requires a total of 10 SL in an Extended Art Test,
with each Test representing a week’s work
Specialisations: Cartography, Engraving, Mosaics, Painting,
Sculpture, Tattoo, Weaving
Athletics (Ag) basic
Your ability to run, jump and move with speed or grace, and to
perform any general physical activity Refer to Moving (see page
164) for details on using Athletics in combat movement
ski l ls and talents IV
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Bribery (Fel) basic
Your ability to judge how likely a person is to accept a bribe, and
how best to offer the bribe so they will accept it
A successful Bribery Test tells you if a target may be bribed If so,
your GM will secretly determine the price of their cooperation
using the target’s Earnings (see page 52), increasing the amount
according to their usual honesty and the risk involved in taking
the bribe You then guess that target amount and the GM will
tell you if the price is higher, lower, or equal Each SL from your
initial Bribery Test gives you another guess At the end of this
process, you determine how much money to offer, based on what
you have gleaned
Example: Snorri is trying to bribe his way past a city watchman;
a character of the Brass Tier 2, meaning they roll 4d10 Brass for
Income The GM decides the guard can be bribed and secretly
rolls 21 on the 4d10, meaning the price for bribing the guard is
21 Brass Letting Snorri through isn’t too risky for the watchman,
and he does it often, so the GM doesn’t increase the bribe required
Snorri rolls 1 SL on his Bribery Test; so, he knows the watchman is
open to a bribe, and has 2 guesses as to his price Snorri’s first guess
is 15 Brass, to which his GM replies ‘higher’ His second guess is
40, to which his GM replies ‘lower’ Snorri now knows he must
bribe the watchman between 15 and 40 Brass, so decides to aim
high, and offers 30 Smiling, the watchman waves Snorri through
In combat, you may use Bribery as above to try to stop the fight,
but treat the Test as Hard (–20) owing to the stress of the situation
If your target is not susceptible, you cannot afford the fee, or your
foes do not speak your tongue, your pathetic attempts to buy them
off will be doomed to fail Of course, if they have the advantage of
numbers, what’s to prevent them from taking all of your money?
Channelling (WP) advanced, grouped
The Channelling Skill measures your ability to call upon and
control the various Winds of Magic, and is solely used by the
magic rules Channelling is a special skill in that it is both
Grouped, allowing for Specialisations, and also ungrouped, for
those not properly trained to channel magic See Chapter 8:
Magic for details concerning this
Specialisations: Aqshy, Azyr, Chamon, Dhar, Ghur, Ghyran,
Hysh, Shyish, Ulgu (each is a different Wind of Magic, see
Chapter 8: Magic for more on this)
Charm (Fel) basic
Charm makes people think favourably of you, your opinions,
and proposed actions Passing an Opposed Charm/Cool Test
allows you to influence the behaviour of one or more targets, up
to a maximum number equal to your Fellowship Bonus + SL,
affecting those with the lowest Willpower first If a target is
amenable to your Charm, the Test will be uncontested
Your GM may permit you to use Charm in Combat if they think
your foes might be susceptible to you pleading for your life or
making persuasive arguments to stop the violence (although
good luck charming a Goblin)!
If you use Charm as your Action, calculate the number of targets
affected as normal If you use it to defend, you only affect your
attacker If you succeed, any affected targets will not attack you
this round and you gain +1 Advantage as normal You may do this
in successive rounds until you choose to stop or fail a Charm Test,
after which your words carry no more weight
Public Speaking
The Charm Skill can be used to make impressive speeches to
sway multiple targets to your way of thinking Assuming they
can hear you and are inclined to listen, you can influence up
to your Fellowship Bonus + SL targets with a single Charm
Test, influencing targets with the lowest Willpower first If the
crowd is unruly, or not receptive to your words, the Test is
Opposed by the crowd’s average Willpower (typically 35) A
failure shows the crowd is unconvinced
The Public Speaking and Master Orator Talents can
significantly increase the number of people you affect with
public speaking An Astounding Failure (-6) (see page 152) in
a Charm Test means your crowd quickly becomes an angry
mob, with you as the target of their ire…
Begging
The Charm Skill can be used to beg on the streets A
successful Test will scrounge Fellowship Bonus × SL brass
pennies per hour from passers-by, with the Difficulty modified
by the pitch chosen for begging, and how much sympathy
your appearance can elicit If you score no SL, but still pass
the Skill Test, you only manage to scrounge a single pfennig
An Astounding Failure (-6) means you may have attracted
problems from the local Watchmen, found some trouble with
other, local beggars, or suffer some other significant set-back
Note: characters who are caught begging by their peers or
associates will likely lose Status unless they are already in the
Beggar, or in some other destitute, career
IV
120
Charm Animal (WP) basic
Your aptitude for befriending, quickly calming, or subjugating
animals
Passing a Charm Animal Test allows you to influence the
behaviour of one or more animals, to a maximum of Willpower
Bonus + SL If the target animals are naturally docile, this Test
may be uncontested, but it will generally be Opposed by the
target’s Willpower
In combat, you may use Charm Animal when facing animals If
you succeed, any affected targets will not attack you this Round
and you gain +1 Advantage You may do this in successive rounds
until you choose to stop or fail a Charm Test, after which the
creature’s instincts take over and you have no further influence
Climb (S) basic
The ability to ascend steep or vertical surfaces
If time isn’t an issue, and a climb is relatively easy, anyone with
Climb Skill is automatically assumed to be able to climb any
reasonably small height
For any other climbing, refer to page 165, which also handles
Climbing during combat You may even find yourself climbing
large opponents, though whether that is prudent is debatable
Consume Alcohol (T) basic
Your ability to handle alcohol without letting it cloud your
judgment or render you senseless
After each alcoholic drink make a Consume Alcohol Test,
modified by the strength of the drink For each Test you fail, you
suffer a –10 penalty to WS, BS, Ag, Dex, and Int, to a maximum
of –30 per Characteristic After you fail a number of Tests equal
to your Toughness Bonus, you are Stinking Drunk Roll on the
following table to see what happens:
1d10 Stinking Drunk
1-2 ‘Marienburgher’s Courage!’: Gain a bonus
of +20 to your Cool Skill
3-4 ‘You’re My Besht Mate!’: Ignore all your
existing Prejudices and Animosities (see page
190)
5-6 ‘Why’s Everything Wobbling!’: On your
Turn, you can either Move or take an Action,
but not both (see page 157)
7-8 ‘I’ll Take Yer All On!’: Gain Animosity
(Everybody!) (see page 190)
9-10 ‘How Did I Get here?’: You wake up the
next day, massively hungover, with little
memory of what transpired The GM
and other players with you will fill in the
embarrassing gaps if you investigate Pass
a Consume Alcohol Test or also gain a
Poisoned Condition (see page 169)
After not drinking for an hour, enact a Challenging (+0)
Consume Alcohol Test The effects of being drunk will wear
off after 10–SL hours, with any Characteristic modifiers for
being drunk lost over that time After all effects wear off, enact
another Challenging (+0) Consume Alcohol Test You now
gain a hangover, which is an Fatigued Condition that cannot be
removed for 5–SL hours
You may expend 1 Resolve point to ignore the negative modifiers
of being drunk until the end of the next round (see page 171)
Cool (WP) basic
Cool allows you to remain calm under stress, resist fear when
faced with horror, and stick to your convictions
Cool is generally used to resist other Skills — Charm, Intimidate,
and similar — but you may also be required to make a Cool Test
when faced with anything forcing you to do something you
would rather not Cool is also the primary Skill used to limit
Psychology (see page 190)

Dodge (Ag) basic
Dodge is your ability to avoid things, through ducking, diving,
and moving quickly, and is used extensively to sidestep falling
rocks, incoming weapons, unexpected traps, and the like
In combat, Dodge is generally used to resist attacks or avoid
damage Refer to Chapter 5: Rules for more on this
Drive (Ag) basic
Drive lets you guide vehicles — most commonly simple carts
and lumbering coaches, not to mention the more ‘experimental’
creations of the Imperial Engineers — along the roads of the
Empire with as little incident as possible
Under normal circumstances, if you possess the Drive Skill, there
is no need to Test If conditions are less than ideal — perhaps the
road is in poor condition, or the weather is terrible — a Drive Test
will be required If you do not possess the Drive Skill, you may be
required to make a Test to carry out even basic manoeuvres An
Astounding Failure (-6) on a Drive Test means something bad
has happened Roll on the following table:
1d10 Result
1-2 Snapped Harness: One horse (or equivalent)
breaks free; reduce speed accordingly
3-5 Jolted Carriage: Passengers suffer 1 Wound
and fragile cargos might be damaged
6-8 Broken Wheel: Pass a Drive Test every
round to avoid Crashing Two-wheeled
vehicles with a Broken Wheel Crash
automatically
9-10 Broken Axle: The vehicle goes out of control
and Crashes
Crashing: Occupants of Crashing vehicles usually suffer 2d10
Wounds modified by Toughness Bonus and Armour Points
unless the vehicle was moving slowly (as determined by the
GM) Crashed vehicles must be repaired by someone with an
appropriate Trade Skill, such as Trade (Carpenter) or Trade
(Cartwright) Spare wheels can be installed by anyone with a
Drive Test or with an appropriate Trade Test
In combat, Drive may be used if circumstances allow — for
instance, if the party is in a coach being raided by outlaws, and
you wish to ram an enemy, or outrun them (see page 165)
Endurance (T) basic
The Endurance Skill is called upon when you must endure
hardship, withstand deprivation, sit without moving for long
periods of time, or survive harsh environments In particular,
Endurance is Tested to resist or recover from various Conditions
(see page 167) and helps you recover lost Wounds Refer to
Chapter 5: Rules for more on this
Entertain (Fel) basic, grouped
Allows you to delight crowds with the spoken word, perhaps by
singing, acting, or attempting a few jokes A successful use of the
Entertain Skill means you have entertained patrons near enough
to hear you; the SL indicates how well you have done
In combat, it is unlikely that Entertain will be of much use,
although you may come up with an interesting way to use
Entertain (Acting) to confuse or mislead your opponents
Specialisations: Acting, Comedy, Singing, Storytelling
Evaluate (Int) advanced
Lets you determine the value of rare artefacts, unusual trade
goods, and works of art Everybody is assumed to know the
relative worth of general items, but a successful use of the
Evaluate allows you to identify the value of curious and unique
items A successful Evaluate Test may also alert you if the goods
(or coins) you are studying are counterfeit — this Test will
usually be Opposed by the forger’s SL on their Art or Trade
Test Your GM may apply modifiers based on just how rare or
obscure the item is, or on your character’s particular expertise
or background
Gamble (Int) basic
Allows you to measure the likelihood that a bet will pay off, as
well as successfully engage in various games of chance
To represent a gambling match, all players make a Gamble Test
— applying any appropriate modifiers for familiarity with the
game — and the player with the highest SL wins On a tie, any
lower scoring players drop out, and those remaining enact another
Gamble Test, repeating this process until you have a winner
If you wish to influence the game through less honest mechanics,
see Sleight of Hand
Options
Some players prefer to use immersive mini-games at the
table, playing real card or dice games to aid the roleplaying
experience If you do this, a successful Gamble Test will allow
you to influence the game once — by drawing an extra card,
or rerolling a die for example — as the GM dictates Each SL
affords you another opportunity to influence the game
IV
122
Gossip (Fel) basic
You can quickly ferret out interesting and useful news, and
spread rumours of your own A successful Gossip Test means
you have found out one useful piece of information, which your
GM can impart to you, about the local area Each SL either
offers you an additional piece of information, or the chance
to spread a rumour to a number of individuals equal to your
Fellowship Bonus The time required for a Gossip Test depends
on how circumspect the players are being, and how busy the
area is, as determined by the GM
It is unlikely that Gossip will be much use in combat, but if your
attacker happens to be local, and you happen to know something
really juicy…
Half-heard Whispers
While it may be expedient for GMs to quickly share
information gleaned from Gossip Tests to all players at
once, it is often more fun to share the information only
with individual players (either through a note, or through
briefly taking them aside) This means the players must relate
this information to one another in-character — aiding the
immersive roleplaying experience — which allows for mistakes
and misunderstandings, sometimes leading to hilarious, or
horrific, results
Haggle (Fel) basic
Haggle allows you to secure better deals when negotiating with
others In general, Haggle is used to see whether you do, or do
not, make a good deal, most commonly with an Opposed Haggle
Test Specifically, it can be used when shopping to secure better
prices For information on this, refer to Chapter 11: Consumers’
Guide
Heal (Int) advanced
You’ve been trained to deal with injuries and diseases A successful
Heal Test allows you to do one of the following:
	 Diagnose an illness, infection, or disease
	 Treat a disease (see page 188)
	 Heal wounds equal to your Intelligence Bonus + SL (Note:
a patient can only benefit from one Heal roll after each
encounter) If sterile liquids or appropriate poultices and
dressings are used, no Infection will develop from the injury
(see page 181)
	 Staunch a Bleeding Condition, with each SL removing an
extra Bleeding Condition
A Failed Heal Test can potentially cause Wounds if your
Intelligence Bonus + SL totals less than 0 On an Astounding
Failure, your patient will also contract a Minor Infection (see
page 187)
If administering to someone who has a disease, a successful Heal
Test ensures that you do not contract the disease for that day
Each SL also prevents one other character encountering the
patient that day from catching the disease For each full day the
patient spends resting under your care, the duration of the disease
is reduced by one, to a minimum of one For more information
see Disease and Infection in Chapter 5: Rules
Certain injuries require Surgery; see the Surgery Talent for
details For more information on healing wounds, refer to Injury
in Chapter 5: Rules
Your GM may apply modifiers to Heal Tests to reflect the
virulence of the disease, the suitability of conditions and
materials, or the stress of your circumstances If healing during
combat, Tests will likely be Challenging (+0) at the very least
Intimidate (S) basic
Allows you to coerce or frighten sentient creatures The precise
manner of initiating an Intimidate Test depends on context:
while it is generally accompanied by an overt threat, sometimes a
subtle implication or even a look is enough Intimidate is almost
always Opposed by your target’s Cool Skill; if successful, you
can intimidate a number of targets up to your Strength Bonus
+ SL Each will react to Intimidate based on their individual
personalities and how successful you were in menacing them, but
in all cases, they will back down or move out of the way and will
not speak out against you, or they will alternatively accept combat
is the only way forward and prepare their weapons
In combat, you cause Fear (see page 190) in all Intimidated targets
You may also use your Intimidate Skill instead of Melee when
defending against those afraid of you, causing the Intimidated
parties to back away from the fight with your will and posture
alone Further, with your GM’s approval, you may use Intimidate
to ‘attack’ such targets, issuing specific commands, such as ‘drop
your weapons’ or ‘get out of here!’ However, if you fail any of
these subsequent Intimidate Tests, you no longer Intimidate (or
cause Fear) in affected opponents With your GM’s permission
you may try to Intimidate them again in a later Round, but this
will incur a negative modifier, as they are less likely to fear you
having seen through your bravado once already
Example: Facing a group of footpads, Svetlana the Strong rolls 4
SL on her Intimidate Test Combined with her SB of 5, this means
she can affect up to 9 targets, more than enough to impact all three
footpads who now Fear Svetlana As she has won by 3 SL, she
gains +1 Advantage point until the end of her next turn In the next
round, she ‘attacks’ the footpads using her Intimidate, intending to
scare them into leaving her be However, she fails the Test, and the
footpads realise they outnumber her, and are armed…

Options: Alternative
Characteristics for Intimidate
While Strength is the default stat for Intimidate Tests, the GM
may decree certain situations may allow you to use a different
Characteristic: a steely witch hunter may use Willpower to
stare down an inquisitive bystander, or an academic may
use Intelligence to cow a lowly student with his intimidating
knowledge, for instance
Intuition (I) basic
The Intuition Skill allows you to get a feel for your surroundings,
leading you to notice when something is wrong, and gives you
a sense of when people may be hiding something from you A
successful use of the Intuition Skill gives you subtle or implicit
intelligence relating to your environment, determined by your
GM This may be information such as whether someone believes
what they are saying, what the general attitude is towards the
local noble, or if the helpful local’s motives are as pure as they
seem If someone is actively trying to hide their intent, they may
resist your Intuition with Cool or Entertain (Acting)
In combat, a successful Intuition Test may be used to give you +1
Advantage as you weigh the environment and your opponents
You may continue building Advantage in subsequent turns
providing you are able to observe your targets and are not
interrupted (such as being attacked); you may gain a maximum
Advantage equal to your Intelligence Bonus in this manner
Language (Int) advanced, grouped
The Language Skill grants you access to extra languages beyond
your native tongue All characters are automatically assumed to
be able to speak ‘Reikspiel’ — the language of the Empire —
and their native language (if your character has one different to
Reikspiel), without ever having to Test If your game is not set in
the Empire, replace Reikspiel with the local language
If you possess a Language Skill, you are generally able to make
yourself understood in that language, or to understand simple
concepts You will be asked to Test your Language Skill when
a particularly difficult concept must be conveyed, or an obscure
dialect or vocabulary is employed
Note: Language (Magick) is used to cast spells and may
occasionally be Tested, with… unpleasant consequences if failed
Refer to Chapter 8: Magic, for more on this
Specialisations: Battle Tongue, Bretonnian, Classical, Guilder,
Khazalid, Magick, Thief, Tilean
Options: Battle Tongue
Battle Tongue represents a series of simple commands and
gestures that may be made in the heat of combat Players
with Language (Battle Tongue) may communicate briefly with
one another during combat without penalty Those without
the Skill cannot quickly coordinate their attacks or discuss
strategy once combat begins

Language Spoken by…
Albion …the folk of Albion, who hail from a far-off mist-shrouded island-realm and are rarely encountered
Battle Tongue …warriors of the Old World It is very common amongst soldiers and mercenaries and is used for giving
orders swiftly during battle It was supposedly developed by the goddess Myrmidia when she walked the
Old World as a mortal
Bretonnian …the folk of Bretonnia, who are commonly encountered in the Reikland Bretonnia is a chivalric realm
to the south-west of the Empire
Classical …Human academics of all kinds It is the first recorded Human language of the Old World — over 3,000
years old — used in most scholarly texts of the Empire including wizard grimoires and many holy books
Elthárin …the folk of Athel Loren, the Laurelorn, and visiting merchants from Ulthuan Elthárin is the language
of the Elves The tonal language has many dialects, and is notoriously difficult for non-Elves to learn
Estalian …the folk of Estalia, people of the hot, southern-western kingdoms known for their bitter politics and
worship of the goddess Myrmidia
Gospodarinyi …the folk of Kislev, a hardy people from the frozen oblasts to the east of the Empire The language is
often called ‘Kislevarin’ or ‘Kislevite’ by outsiders
Grumbarth …Ogres; few others learn this simple tongue, though some mercenary commanders find it useful for
communicating with any Ogres they may hire
Khazalid …the folk of Karaz Ankor, the Dwarf kingdoms in the mountains This language is also wide-spread
through the Cult of Sigmar, which venerates the strong relationship Sigmar had with the Dwarfs when
he was mortal
Magick …wizards; a tonal language used to shape the Winds of Magic into material effects The academic form
of the language taught by the Colleges of Magic is called the Lingua Praestantia, which is quite different
to the debased form of the language used by witches and the untrained It is not a language used for
communication
Mootish …the folk of the Mootland; ie: the Halfling grand province in the Empire This language is little
known outside the Moot
Norse …the folk of Norsca Norse is commonly spoken across the north of the Empire in Nordland and
Ostland, and is well-known in the Wasteland and Kislev, too
Reikspiel …the folk of the Empire Reikspiel is the primary language used in most WFRP games It manifests
in uncounted discrete dialects from across the Empire, most of which are mutually intelligible It is the
modern version of the tongue once spoken by the God-King Sigmar when he still walked as a mortal
over two thousand five hundred years ago
Queekish …the folk of the Under-Empire Used by the Skaven and their many slaves Few admit to speaking it, or
even being aware of its existence

realm; eg Tileans sport a completely different ‘Thieves Tongue’ to folk of the Empire
Wastelander the rural folk of the Wasteland, a windswept territory to the west of the Reikland The official language
of the Wasteland’s capital, Marienburg, is Reikspiel, a reminder that the realm was once part of the

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Leadership (Fel) basic
A measure of your ability to lead others and command their
respect While most often associated with martial situations, a
resolute leader can quickly direct a fast response to a fire or other
such calamity, and nobles use the Skill frequently to command
their lessers
A successful Leadership Test allows you to issue orders to a
number of targets equal to your Fellowship Bonus + SL If the
targets are your natural subordinates — a noble commanding
serfs, or a sergeant commanding his troops — commands are
usually unopposed If there is no natural hierarchy in place, or the
order is particularly challenging — such as ordering your soldiers
to charge a Hydra head on — the Test is Opposed by your targets’
Cool
In combat, you may use Leadership to encourage your
subordinates A successful Leadership Test confers a bonus of
+10 to all Psychology Tests until the end of the next round (see
page 190)
Further, Leadership can be used to transfer Advantage to allies
able to hear you; following a successful Leadership Test, you may
transfer an Advantage to one ally of your choice, plus a further +1
Advantage per SL scored, which can again go to any allies of your
choice within earshot
Example: Lord Ludwig von Schemp has been watching his two
bodyguards discourse with some ruffians for three Rounds, using
his Intuition Skill to build up 3 Advantage Feeling it is going
nowhere, he issues a peremptory order to attack the ringleader;
passing his Leadership Test with 5 SL, he gives one bodyguard
2 of his Advantage, and the remaining bodyguard 1 Advantage,
hoping this will bring a swift end to proceedings
Who’s the Boss?
GMs should be aware that having Players issue orders to other
Players may cause friction within the party If you have Players
who are of differing social class, or military ranks, be sure to
discuss how this will be reflected in your intraparty dynamics
to ensure a smooth and enjoyable game for everyone
Lore (Int) advanced, grouped
Having a Lore Skill means you’ve been formally taught, or have
somehow otherwise learned, a branch of specialist knowledge
Possessing a Lore Skill means you are broadly knowledgeable in
the specialisation and don’t need to make a Test in order for the
GM to supply you with relevant facts If you are seeking specific,
less well-known information, you will be required to make a Lore
Test, modified by how obscure the information is, with the SL
indicating how much detail you recall
In combat, successful Lore Tests may afford you +1 Advantage
if appropriate (with your GM’s approval) For instance, Lore
(Geology) may give you an edge if fighting in a rocky cavern,
or Lore (Engineering) may help you if fighting a foe armed
with a complex mechanical device You may continue building
Advantage in subsequent turns providing the circumstances are
correct (as determined by the GM) and you are not interrupted;
you may gain a maximum Advantage equal to your Intelligence
Bonus in this manner
Specialisations: Engineering, Geology, Heraldry, History, Law,
Magick, Metallurgy, Science, Theology
Melee (WS) basic, grouped
The Melee Skill represents specific training with a single type
of close combat weaponry Each Melee Specialisation indicates
training in using a specific class of weapon If you don’t have
the correct Specialisation for a weapon you wish to use, refer to
Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide for the correct weapon entry,
and what penalties you will sufferSee Chapter 5: Rules for more
detail about combat and using the Melee Skill
Specialisations: Basic, Brawling, Cavalry, Fencing, Flail, Parry,
Pole-Arm, Two-Handed
Navigation (I) basic
Navigation allows you to find your way in the wilderness using
landmarks, stellar bodies or maps Possessing the Navigation Skill
means you know roughly where you are, and can find your way
between well-known landmarks without a Test A Test is only
required if you are disoriented or travelling far from the beaten
path, with success showing you the correct direction, or allowing
you to avoid mishap
If you are navigating a long journey, your GM may ask for an
extended Navigation Test, modified by conditions, visible
landmarks, and access to reliable geographical information The
SL required to succeed depends on how far the destination is,
with each Test representing between an hour and a day’s travel,
depending on the nature of the journey
Outdoor Survival (Int) basic
The Outdoor Survival Skill is used to survive in the wild,
including the ability to fish, hunt, forage, and build fires and
shelters Experienced travellers are skilled at reading the signs
of incoming inclement weather and finding the spoor of various
dangerous beasts
When camping, make an Outdoor Survival Test, modified by the
harshness of conditions — for instance, a Test is Challenging (+0)
if it is raining, Hard (–20) in a storm A successful Test indicates
IV
126
you can provide yourself sustenance and shelter for the night
Each SL allows you to provide for one more character If the Test
is failed, you must make a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test
or receive the Fatigued Condition If you suffer an Astounding
Failure, something untoward has happened, as determined by the
GM; perhaps your camp is attacked in the night?
When fighting in the wilderness, you may make an Outdoor
Survival Test to receive +1 Advantage, in the same way as
Intuition, to a maximum number of Advantage equal to your
Intelligence Bonus, as you spy out treacherous and advantageous
terrain that you can best use to your advantage
Options:
 Gathering Food
and Herbs
Gathering food or herbs normally takes around 2 hours
Hunting and foraging parties make one Assisted Outdoor
Survival Test for the group, with the Difficulty determined by
the circumstances
	 Foraging: A success grants enough food for one character
Every SL yields sufficient extra food for one more person
	 Hunting and Fishing: If you have appropriate bows,
spears, fishing rods, or nets, a successful Test feeds two
people, and an extra two people per SL
	 Trapping: Use the Set Trap Skill to place Animal traps
(see page 303) Feeds the same number of people as
Hunting and Fishing
	 Lore (Herbalism): If you are instead gathering herbs using
Lore (Herbalism), a success gathers enough for a dose
of the sought herb (see page 307), with each SL adding
an extra dose Gathering tests are modified by herb
Availability: Common (0), Scarce (–10), Rare (–20),
or Exotic (–30)
Perception (I) basic
Your ability to notice things with your senses — sight, smell,
hearing, touch, and taste, and any other senses you may possess,
such as magical or non-Human senses Your GM may ask for a
Perception Test to detect something, like movement behind the
treeline, the presence of a trap, or someone following you, modified
by how easy it is to notice Perception is also used to resist attempts
to hide things through Skills such as Sleight of Hand or Stealth
Perception has multiple uses in combat, most commonly to
notice important details beyond the immediately obvious about
the surrounding environment and your opponents, as determined
by the GM
Perform (Ag) advanced, grouped
You’ve learned a physically demanding art, perhaps as a way
of making a living, maybe as a street entertainer or as part of a
travelling carnival A successful use of the Perform Skill allows
you to entertain all patrons close enough to see and hear you; the
SL indicate how well you have done
In combat, certain physical Perform specialisations may give you
an edge With your GM’s permission, Perform (Acrobatics) may
be used in lieu of Dodge Other Perform Skills may be useful in
distracting foes, perhaps gaining you an Advantage if you can
come up with a creative way to do so And some Perform skills
can be directly used as a weapon if you have the correct trappings,
such as Perform (Firebreathing)!
Specialisations: Acrobatics, Clowning, Dancing, Firebreathing,
Juggling, Miming, Rope Walking
Pick Lock (Dex) advanced
You know the mechanisms of locks and how to open them
without their proper keys Picking a lock is often an Extended
Test, with the number of SL required to open the lock dependent
on the complexity of the lock
Locks and Lock Picks
Lock Difficulty ratings assume the use of lock picks
Improvised picks such as hairpins and nails can be used at
–10 penalty Each Test normally takes a Round to complete,
though the GM may determine some locks are particularity
stiff or rusted, and take longer If the GM deems a lock
is sufficiently simple, unskilled characters can attempt a
single Very Hard (–30) Dexterity Test to pick the lock The
following provides some standard difficulties for locks typically
encountered in the Old World
Lock Type Difficulty SL
Latch Average (+20) 0
Normal Door Challenging (+0) 2
Secure Door Difficult (–10) 2
Treasure Chest Hard (–20) 5
Vault Door Very Hard (–30) 10

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Play (Dex) advanced, grouped
Your ability to make music with an instrument, hopefully
well enough to impress others A successful Play Test lets you
entertain those near enough to see and hear you; the SL indicates
the quality of the piece played
Specialties: Bagpipe, Lute, Harpsichord, Horn, Violin
The Old World’s a Stage…
While there is some overlap between the Skills of Entertain,
Perform, and Play, each reflects a distinct group of Skills
Entertain is a Basic Skill using Fellowship It represents those
Skills of entertainment that anyone can attempt, even without
training, such as singing or telling stories
Perform is an Advanced Skill using Agility Perform
Specialisations require training to attempt, and rely on physical
speed and coordination
Play is also an Advanced Skill, this time using Dexterity It
represents training in specific musical instruments, all of which
need teaching and practice to perform well
You should choose carefully when determining whether your
chosen Specialisation belongs to Entertain, Perform, or Play;
consider how the character will physically enact the Skill, and
whether an untrained beginner could do so with any success
After all, someone without any musical training could feasibly
sing beautifully, but hand them a set of bagpipes…
Pray (Fel) advanced
Your ability to invoke, or otherwise commune with, a deity
For more information on using the Pray Skill to seek divine
intervention, see Chapter 7: Religion & Belief
In combat, if your GM deems it appropriate considering your
circumstances and faith, you may use Pray to meditate and focus
your mind Each round you spend praying in combat — and
making a successful Pray Test — gives you +1 Advantage You
can gain additional Advantage this way, up to a maximum of your
Fellowship Bonus
Further, if your enemies understand your language and recognise
(and fear) your deity, the GM may allow you to use Pray in lieu
of the Intimidate Skill
Ranged (BS) advanced, grouped
Whilst anyone can throw a rock simply using their Ballistic Skill,
it takes training and practice to use weapons like bows and pistols
Each Ranged Specialisation is specific to a group of ranged
weapons If you don’t have the Ranged Specialisation for a
weapon you wish to use, refer to Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide
to see what penalties you will suffer when using the weapon See
Chapter 5: Rules for full detail about ranged combat
Specialisations: Blackpowder, Bow, Crossbow, Engineering,
Entangling, Explosives, Sling, Throwing
Research (Int) advanced
How adept you are at pulling useful and frequently obscure
knowledge from libraries and other such storehouses of
information Research requires you have the Read/Write Talent
(see page142)
Simply possessing the Research Skill indicates you can find
straightforward information from a clearly indexed library
without a Test given enough time If you are seeking specific,
IV
less well-known information, or you are in a rush, you will be
required to make an Extended Research Test, with the Difficulty
modified by the library size, and the target SL depending upon
the obscurity of the topic
Research has no use in combat beyond perhaps finding you a
useful manual on sword-fighting techniques
Research and Libraries
Libraries of the Old World vary from small personal libraries
of a few dozen books to vast archives found in the universities
and temples of the towns and cities
Using a Research Test in a small library, perhaps to find a
specific book, only takes about 5 minutes By comparison,
Research Tests in large libraries can easily takes an hour or
more per Test, but are far more likely to find esoteric lore
Ride (Ag) basic, grouped
How proficient you are at riding a particular group of animals;
Ride (Horse), for example, will let you ride Horses, Mules,
Donkeys, and similar You’ll only need to make a Test when doing
something out of the ordinary, such as racing, dressage, traversing
dangerous terrain, or charging into combat Otherwise, if you
have at least one Advance in the Skill, you are presumed to be
able to ride around without need of a Test
If mounted on a steed, you move using the steed’s Movement
statistic; if you wish to run, jump, or leap, you use your Ride Skill,
not Athletics An extended Ride Test may be needed if you are
racing somewhere, the target SL depending on the length of the
journey, the number of Tests indicating how long you take to
arrive A Ride Test may be modified by environmental conditions,
and the temperament of your mount For more information on
mounts, see Chapter 12: Bestiary
The Ride skill can be used extensively in combat See Chapter 5:
Rules, for more on mounted combat
Specialisations: Demigryph, Great Wolf, Griffon, Horse,
Pegasus
Row (S) basic
Your prowess at pulling an oar and moving a boat through the
water The Row Skill is typically only used when racing, navigating
rapids, desperately avoiding Bog Octopuses, or similar unusual or
dangerous feats Anyone with the Skill is automatically presumed
to be able to scull about a pond, or over a gentle river, without
a Test Those without the skill may have to make a Test for
anything but the most basic manoeuvres
Sail (Ag) advanced, grouped
Your ability to operate and manoeuvre a sailing vessel — including
knotwork, steering, gauging the wind, and more Assuming you
have enough trained crew for your vessel, you only use the Sail
Skill when you must push your vessel to perform, either by racing,
navigating particularly dangerous shoals, struggling against bad
weather, or similar difficulties Simply sailing with a gentle wind,
or guiding a ship downriver, doesn’t require a Test for those with
Sail The skill can also be used for sailing-related activities like
tying knots, or tying others up in knots
As sailing one ship is not so different to sailing another, having
any Sail Speciality makes all other Sail Specialities Basic Skills
for you
Specialisations: Barge, Caravel, Cog, Frigate, Wolfship
Secret Signs (Int) advanced, grouped
You’ve been taught how to use clandestine markings only
intelligible to members of a select group There are all manner
of reasons why someone may want to leave a secret message:
vagabonds might indicate which homeowners are likely to offer
alms, thieves may want to indicate weaknesses, or likely marks,
while scouts may want to warn one another about a dangerous
monster’s lair nearby
This Skill does not usually need to be Tested — you can decipher
any appropriate signs you can see if you have this Skill But if the
signs have been disturbed, worn away, or if you are pressed for
time, then a Test will likely be required Most messages are very
simple, no more than three words

I Saw The Sign…
This is a list of the primary secret signs of the Old World,
and those who use them This is only a tiny sample of those
most commonly used in the Reikland; there are many more
than this short list suggests, and you are encouraged to create
those best fitting your game
Secret
Signs Used by…
Grey
Order
…Grey Wizards The secretive Greys
use a complex array of signs, many only
perceptible to wizards They mark the
land for their wandering magisters,
highlighting safe houses, places of danger,
areas where wizards are unwelcome, and
much more besides
Guilder …guilders Many of the larger guilds,
from masons to stevedores, have an
array of marks and signs used to identify
matters of importance to their members
Ranger …woodsmen and other rural folk Ranger
signs are mostly used to mark territory,
point out areas of importance or danger,
and indicate safe paths
Scout …scouts, particularly those employed
by armies and mercenary companies
The signs are mostly used to point out
foraging areas, routes for supply trains,
and significant dangers ahead
Thief …thieves and rogues The various gangs
and criminal outfits of the towns and
cities use a variety of marks to point out
bolt holes, easy marks, well-patrolled
areas, and more
Vagabond …wandering vagabonds and pedlars
Vagabond signs are mostly used to
identify safe places to sleep, villages to
avoid, and sources of food and water
Set Trap (Dex) advanced
From a simple snare, or bear-trap, to more spectacular devices
like Von Grizzel’s Thief-Render, players are unlikely to venture
far in the Old World without encountering traps The Set
Trap Skill measures your ability to set and disarm traps of
all varieties Anyone with the skill is automatically assumed
to be able to activate and disarm traps given enough time A
Test is normally only required if attempting to use the Skill
swiftly or if otherwise under pressure, or if the trap is especially
complex A selection of simple traps can be found in Chapter
11: Consumers’ Guide
Setting or disarming most traps requires an Average (+20%) Set
Trap Test, but more complex devices may require an extended
Test, needing several SL over multiple rounds to set
Sleight of Hand (Dex) advanced
Lets you pick pockets, palm objects, and perform minor tricks
of prestidigitation, as well as cheating with games of chance
This Skill is typically Opposed by the Perception Skill of your
target; success means you have palmed the object, picked the
pocket, or swapped the cards, while a Marginal Success (+0 to
+1) may suggest that your nefarious misdeeds have left your
opponent suspicious
You can also use Sleight of Hand to ‘help’ your Gamble Skill
when playing appropriate games of chance Before any round (or
similar, depending upon the game at hand) you can attempt a
Sleight of Hand Test (which will be opposed if others suspect)
If successful, you may reverse your Gamble Test for the round
if this will score a Success If failed, your opponents may not be
best pleased…
Sleight of Hand and combat rarely mix, though inventive players
may be able to conjure an impressive distraction with GM
approval, perhaps even gaining Advantage by making a Dagger
seemingly appear from nowhere, surprising a superstitious foe
Stealth (Ag) basic, grouped
Allows you to creep quietly and conceal yourself in shadows more
readily than most Stealth is generally Opposed by an opponent’s
Perception Skill, and Tests will be modified by how dark or well
concealed your route is, as well as how circumspectly you are
dressed An Impressive or Astounding Failure on a Stealth Test
will likely draw the immediate attention of the enemies you were
trying to avoid in the first place
Stealth has many potential applications in combat, most usefully
to hide oneself in preparation for an Ambush, or to creep around
an opponent in order to attack from behind See Chapter 5:
Rules for the implications of this Of course, you can also use the
Skill to escape a conflict unseen…
Specialisations: Rural, Underground, Urban
Options: Shadowing
Shadowing is following someone secretly To do this requires
a Combined Perception and Stealth Test (see page 155) If
the target is actively trying to lose a tail, it is Opposed with
the target’s Stealth Skill
If you pass the Perception Test, and fail the Stealth Test you
follow your target, but are spotted If you fail the Perception
Test, yet pass the Stealth Test, you lose your target, but go
unnoticed
IV
130
Swim (S) advanced
Your ability to swim in water without drowning If you have the
Swim Skill, you are automatically presumed to be able to swim
freely without a Test But if you find yourself in difficult currents,
racing, or fleeing from an oversized shark sent by Stromfels, the
God of Drowning, a Test will be required This may be modified
by the condition of the water, or how encumbered you are by
clothes, armour, and other trappings
Swim is only used in combat if you happen to be fighting in the
water, where it replaces Skills like Athletics to govern Movement
If exact speeds are required, you swim at half your Movement
rate, using the normal rules for moving found on page 164
Track (I) advanced
Your ability to follow subtle trails left by others Track is used
to follow difficult trails across the wilderness This is not a
skill for following a set of footprints in the snow — a simple
Perception test covers that — Track involves deeper knowledge
and awareness used to recognise the subtle signs of a quarry’s
passage You can also attempt to hide your trail, in which case use
your Track skill to oppose your pursuer’s Track Test
Often an Extended Track Test is required to follow a trail,
with the Difficulty modified by how fresh the tracks are, and
how suitable the ground is: damp earth betrays passage better
than stony ground The GM may also use the Pursuit rules to
determine if you manage to track down a fleeing quarry (see page
166)
Trade (Dex) advanced, grouped
Most folk of the Reikland follow a trade; even adventurers often
have a more reliable, or respectable career to fall back on, between
bouts of hair-raising, bowel-loosening excitement
The Trade Skill represents your ability to create something or
provide a service, as well as your knowledge of the relevant lore
surrounding your trade
Having the Skill is enough to automatically perform the tasks
associated with your trade, assuming you have the correct
resources and tools You need only Test your Trade Skill if you
are seeking to create something quickly, conditions are adverse, or
you are seeking to invent or create a high-quality item
Often Trade Tests of this type are extended Test, with the SL and
time required depending upon the scope or scale of what is being
produced; a quick meal with Trade (Cook) to impress a local lord
will take far less time than constructing a warship with Trade
(Shipwright)
You may also make a Trade Test as a Lore Skill, to determine
information relevant to the trade in question In such
circumstances, the GM may prefer to use Int over Dex as the base
Characteristic, though often this is ignored to keep play simple
While most Trade Skills have little function in combat, there
are as many Trade Skills as there are trades, and some may
be of use depending upon the circumstances For example, a
successful Trade (Apothecary) Test may be useful if fighting in
an Apothecary’s shop as you identify some astringent chemicals
to hurl at your foes
The Trade Skill is also used for enacting a Crafting Endeavour
(see page 197)
Specialisations: Apothecary, Calligrapher, Chandler, Carpenter,
Cook, Embalmer, Smith, Tanner

Talents
Where Characteristics represent your raw potential, and Skills
are your training and experience, Talents represent all the tricks,
quirks, and special abilities you have learned throughout life
Gaining Talents
During character creation you will automatically receive a
selection of Talents (see Chapter 2: Character) After this, you
can use Experience Points (XP) to purchase new Talents, or take
existing ones multiple times, if allowed, from the advance scheme
of your Career (see page 48)
If you can take a Talent multiple times, it will either have a
special rule for what this means written into its description, or
it will have an associated Skill marked under ‘Tests’ (see Talent
Format) For each time you have the Talent, you gain +1 SL on
any successful use of a Skill tied to the Talent
Talent Format
The following explains how each Talent is presented
	 Talent Name (situation): The name of the Talent If there
are parentheses, the word within describes a situation the
Talent influences
	 Max: The maximum number of times the Talent may be
taken, which is normally 1 or an associated Characteristic
Bonus
	 Tests: If the Talent is tied to one or more Tests your
character can make, the affected Tests are listed here
Talents tied to a Test come with an extra rule: For each
time you have taken the Talent, you gain +1 SL on any
successful use of the Skill tied to the Talent
	 Description (not titled): A description of what the Talent
does

One of your primary five senses is highly developed, allowing you
to spot what others miss You may take Perception Tests to detect
normally imperceptible details with the associated sense, as
dictated by the GM This could include: seeing an eagle beyond
everyone else’s eyeshot, smelling an almost odourless poison,
hearing the breath of an unmoving mouse within a wall, feeling a
worn away letter in a carving, or tasting that two beers from the
same brewer have been drawn from two different barrels
Aethyric Attunement

IV
132
Animal Affinity
Max: Willpower Bonus
Tests: Charm Animal
Wild animals feel comfortable in your presence, and often follow
your lead All creatures with the Bestial Trait not trained to be
belligerent will automatically be calm in your presence unless they
have a reason not to be, such as pain, an attack, being naturally
hyper-aggressive, or having nearby young
Arcane Magic (Lore)
Max: 1
You either study one of the 8 Arcane Lores of Magic — Beasts,
Death, Fire, Heavens, Metal, Shadow, Light, or Life — or
practice a lesser known Lore, such as Hedgecraft or Necromancy
You may now memorise spells from your chosen Lore for the
following cost in XP
Number of Spells Currently Known XP Cost for a new spell
Intelligence Bonus × 1 100 XP
Intelligence Bonus × 2 200 XP
Intelligence Bonus × 3 300 XP
Intelligence Bonus × 4 400 XP
and so on
So, if your Intelligence Bonus is 4, it will cost you 100 XP for
the first 4 spells, then 200 XP for the next 4, and so on Full
rules for learning new spells are provided in Chapter 8: Magic
Under normal circumstances, you may not learn more than one
Arcane Magic (Lore) Talent Further, you may not learn the Bless

can unlearn this Talent for 100 XP, but will immediately lose all
of your spells if you do so
Argumentative
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Charm Tests when arguing and debating
You are used to arguing your points and winning If you roll

Tests: Trade (Artist)
You have a natural talent for art, able to produce precise sketches
with nothing but time and appropriate media This ability has
several in-game uses, ranging from creating Wanted Posters to

enter; if it is already in Career, you may instead purchase the Skill
for 5 XP fewer per Advance
Attractive
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Charm Tests to influence those attracted to you
Whether it’s your piercing eyes, your strong frame, or maybe the
way you flash your perfect teeth, you know how to make the best
use of what the gods gave you When you successfully use Charm

your rolled SL, or the number rolled on your units die So, a

SL you score This Test is not Opposed This Talent is of no use
if your opponent has no weapon, or has a larger Size than you
(see page 341)
Beneath Notice
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Stealth when in plain sight
The high and mighty pay no attention to your presence, knowing
you are well beneath their notice Assuming you are properly
attired and not in an incongruous position, those of a higher
Status Tier will normally ignore you unless your presence
becomes inappropriate, which can make it very easy to listen into
conversations you perhaps shouldn’t Further, characters with a
higher Status Tier than you gain no Advantage for striking or
wounding you in combat, as there is nothing to be gained for
defeating such a lowly cur
Berserk Charge

the force of your charge to add weight to your strikes When you

Talent
Blather
Max: Fellowship Bonus
Tests: Charm to Blather
Called ‘opening your mouth and letting your belly rumble’ in
Nordland, or simply ‘bullshitting’ in Ostland, blathering involves
talking rapidly and incessantly, or talking volubly and at-length,
about inconsequential or nonsense matters, and is used to verbally
confuse and confound a target You use your Charm Skill to
Blather Attempt an Opposed Charm/Intelligence Test Success
gives your opponent a Stunned Condition Further, for each
level you have in Blather, your opponent gains another Stunned
ski l ls and talents IV
133
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Condition Targets Stunned by Blather may do nothing other
than stare at you dumbfounded as they try to catch-up with or
understand what you are saying Once the last Stunned Condition
comes to an end, the target finally gets a word in, and may not
be best pleased with you — after all, you have been talking about
nothing or nonsense for some time Should you stop talking,
your opponent immediately loses all Stunned Conditions caused
by your Blather Generally, you can only attempt to Blather at a
character once per scene, or perhaps longer as determined by the
GM, as the target soon wises up to your antics
Bless (Divine Lore)
Max: 1

You are used to playing, and winning, at cards, although your
methods may involve a little cheating When you successfully use
Gamble or Sleight of Hand when playing cards, you can choose
to either use your rolled SL, or the number rolled on your units
die So, a successful roll of 28 could be used for +8 SL If you play
a real card game to represent what is happening in-game, you
may receive an extra number of cards per deal equal to your level
in Cardsharp, then discard down to the appropriate hand-size
before each round of play
Careful Strike
Max: Initiative Bonus
You are skilled at hitting your enemy exactly where you want to,
either at range or in melee You may modify your Hit Location result
by up to +/–10 per time you have this Talent So, if you had this

Cat-tongued
Max: Fellowship Bonus

there is something fishy in what you say
Chaos Magic (Lore)
Max: Number of Spells available in chosen Chaos Magic Lore
By accident or design you have lost a portion of your soul to one
of the Dark Gods, and can now practice the foul magics of Chaos

from the chosen Lore (most commonly the Nurgle, Slaanesh, or
Tzeentch Lores) and you gain a Corruption point as the spell
infiltrates your mind, never to be forgotten
Each time you take this Talent, which always costs 100 XP per time

folk rarely stand against you
Concoct
Max: Intelligence Bonus
Tests: Lore (Apothecary)
You are skilled at making potions, philtres, and draughts on
the go You may take one free Crafting Endeavour to use Trade

and you’re not always quiet about it For the purposes of securing
money, either when Earning during play or performing an

Level
Bonus Money per time the
Talent is taken
1 +2d10 brass pennies
2 +1d10 silver shillings
3 +2d10 silver shillings
4 +1 gold crown
Because of your obvious criminal nature, others consider you
lower Status than them unless they also have the Criminal Talent,
where Status is compared as normal — perhaps you have gang
tattoos, look shifty, or are just rough around the edges, it’s your
choice Because of this, local law enforcers are always suspicious
of you and suspect your motivations, which only gets worse the
more times you have this Talent, with the exact implications
determined by the GM Lawbreakers without the Criminal
Talent earn significantly less coin but are not obviously the sort to
be breaking the law, so maintain their Status With GM consent,
you may spend XP to remove levels of the Criminal Talent for the
same XP it cost to buy
Deadeye Shot
Max: 1
You always hit an opponent right between the eyes… or wherever
else you intended to hit Instead of reversing the dice to determine

SL, or the number rolled on your units die So, a successful roll of

opponent loses a held weapon, which flies 1d10 feet in a random
direction (with further effects as determined by the GM) If you
win by 2 SL, you can determine how far the weapon is flung
instead of rolling randomly; if you win by 4 SL, you can also
choose the direction the weapon goes in; if you win by 6 SL or
more, you can take your opponent’s weapon if you have a free
hand, plucking it from the air with a flourish This Talent is of no
use if your opponent has no weapon, or is a larger Size than you
(see page 341)
We’re Doomed!

 Plague and dark disease shall bring thee to thy knees
 Absence makes thy heart grow weaker
 The sword shalt bring no justice, only thine end
 The bun! The pastry! The pie! Lo, they are Morr’s
dishes!
 The drummer beats out thine end
 Thine end is not thine end!
 Though shalt sup deep of the cup of corruption
 High places bring a low end

Dual Wielder
Max: Agility Bonus
Tests: Melee or Ranged when attacking with two weapons
When armed with two weapons, you may attack with both for your
Action Roll to hit with the weapon held in your primary hand
If you hit, determine Damage as normal, but remember to keep
your dice roll, as you will use it again If the first strike hits, once
it is resolved, the weapon in your secondary hand can then target
an available opponent of your choice using the same dice roll for
the first strike, but reversed So, if you rolled 34 to hit with the first
weapon, you use 43 to hit with the second Remember to modify
this second roll by your off-hand penalty (–20 unless you have the
Ambidextrous Talent) This second attack is Opposed with a new
defending roll, and damage for this second strike is calculated as
normal The only exception to this is if you roll a Critical for your
first strike If this happens, use the roll on the Critical Table to also
act as the roll for the second attack So, if you scored a critical to the
head and rolled 56 on the Critical table for a Major Eye Wound,
your second attack would then strike out with a to-hit value of 56
If you choose to attack with both weapons, all your defensive rolls
until the start of your next Turn suffer a penalty of –10 You do
not gain an Advantage when you successfully strike or Wound an
opponent when Dual Wielding unless both attacks hit

 Rules 
V
The game is afoot; grim and perilous The players lean forward in
their seats, listening intently to the GM describing the plot as it
unfolds, excitedly explaining their characters’ actions in response
and breathlessly waiting to hear what happens next…
Roleplaying games often work best with minimal interruptions
to this narrative flow — the smoother the game proceeds, the
more involved everyone will be However, as the adventure
develops, situations will arise where the outcome of a character’s
action is uncertain Maybe a character leaps from a wall to hack
down a pillaging Goblin — will they land poised for action or
flat on their face?
Sometimes, especially with events that don’t affect the players too
much, the GM can simply decide the outcome and relate it to
the group However, if the success or failure of the action has
significant impact on the players, it is more tense and dramatic
to roll some dice and let the fates and a character’s capabilities
determine whether they succeed or fail Using the game rules also
lets players assess their chances and make decisions accordingly
— it’s a fair and transparent way to resolve things
At the core of the rules are Tests — rolls of the dice that determine
outcomes There are also additional rules for more complex or
unusual tasks – see the box for a handy list with page references
The GM should be familiar with these, but as a player you’ll be
fine so long as you know the basics of the different kinds of Test

The Golden Rule
The rules exist to help you enjoy epic stories in the
Warhammer world, so they should never be a barrier to having
fun Arguably, the most important rule in this book is:
If a rule negatively impacts fun for your group, change it or
ignore it
This rule is so important, you will find alternative and optional
rules throughout this book to support building a ruleset that
best suits your group and your style of play If it’s your first
game, ignore these until you become more familiar with how
it all works, and you can experiment with some of the variants
as the mood takes you
Be careful not to confuse ‘fun’ with ‘always succeeding’ — a
sense of risk and the real possibility of failure is an important
part of drama Things going wrong provides players with the
challenge of recovering from setbacks, a central part of any
hero’s journey
Tests
‘Aye, there are times when things just go wrong Really, badly wrong
Like that time half way up the Bögen when Olaf jumped into a tree
but missed and hit that jagged branch square on I think he’s there
still, although there’s probably not much of him left after the animals
had a season’s grazing By Sigmar’s grace, sit yourself down and have
some cheese, there’s nothing good for you out there!’
– Dieter Käsegeier, Cheesemonger, ex-Adventurer
When your character takes an action, the GM will let you know
what happens next Sometimes, the GM will make a call based on
your abilities and any other factors and decide that you achieved
what you were attempting, or that you didn’t If the GM isn’t sure
of the outcome, or if the situation is significant or dangerous, they
can resolve the action using the rules There are a few options, as
the Using Tests box shows Tests compare a dice roll to one of
the characteristics or skills on your character sheet and provide
an outcome
Simple Tests
Simple Tests are used when you need to determine if your
character succeeds or fails at a simple task Does Molli leap the
churning stream? Can Wilhelm charm a lower price from the
truculent merchant? Often, a quick yes or no answer to these
questions allows your adventure to progress swiftly The exception
to this is when a failure would significantly impact the progress
of the adventure, in which case you should use a Dramatic Test
(see page 152) instead
To perform a Simple Test, you roll d100 (see Throwing Bones on
page 6) and compare the result rolled to the Skill or Characteristic
best suited to the action you are attempting
Note this test may be modified by the GM if it is notably easy or
hard to complete (see Difficulty on page 153)
If you roll lower or equal to the Skill or Characteristic, the Test’s
outcome is a success, and your Character performs the task
If you roll higher than the Skill or Characteristic, the Test’s
outcome is a failure, and your Character does not perform the task
Whatever the outcome of the Test, after testing, the GM should
describe what just happened so everyone understands how the
Test has impacted the story
Example: Molli runs across Altdorf ’s Königsplatz on a cold,
winter’s night The cobbles are blanketed in thick snow hiding
treacherous ice beneath, but with a gang of thugs in eager
pursuit Molli is not about to slacken her pace The GM calls
for a Simple Athletics Test to see if Molli can cross the slippery
platz safely Molli’s Athletics is 42, and her player rolls d100
scoring a 17 As 17 is below Molli’s Athletics of 42, the result is
a success, so the answer is yes, Molli can cross without mishap
The GM says that Molli crosses the open snow and darts into
the relative safety of one of the many dark alleyways at the other
side If her player had rolled over 42, Molli would have slipped,
and the thugs would have been upon her!
Talents and Tests
Some Talents can improve a Test’s chances of success, or
grant you access to unique Tests allowing you to attempt
extraordinary feats For more details regarding this, refer to
Talents on page 132
RULES V

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Automatic Failure and Success
No matter how skilled or talented a character is, there is always
a chance of failure Equally, there is always a chance of success in
WFRP, no matter the odds stacked against you
If you roll 96–00 on any Test, it is always a failure A failure
occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is 96 or higher
Similarly, if you roll 01–05 on a Test, it is always a success A
success occurs even if your modified characteristic or skill is less
than 01–05
Options: Autosuccess?
Not At My Table!
Not everybody likes a 5% chance of auto-success on any Test
Similarly, not everyone likes the same chance of auto-failures
If this describes you, then simply change the numbers to your
taste The most common alternative is 96–00 always fails,
and 01 always succeeds
Von Meinkopf’s Preeminent
Probability Paraphernalia
The rules use a selection of mechanics to modify or manipulate
percentile rolls The following explains these in detail:
Rolling a Double: Rolling a double means both the tens and the
units die of a percentile test have rolled the same number For
example: 11, 22, 33, 44 and so on
Reroll: A reroll is when you disregard the result of a dice roll, and
roll it again Once a Test has been rerolled, it cannot be rerolled
again under normal circumstances
Reverse: To reverse a percentile roll, you swap the tens result with
the units result So, a roll of 58 becomes 85, or a roll of 51
becomes 15 Obviously, if you roll a double, it will have the same
result when reversed, so 77 reverses to 77
Modifiers: These numbers are added or subtracted to the one of
your Skill to make the Test easier or more difficult This is most
often referred to as the Difficulty of the roll (see page 153)
If you want to introduce some test-specific outcomes for particularly
dramatic moments, you can use the methods above as a toolkit

Great Game Rules
Game rules establish a mutually agreed and understood foundation for how WFRP works They are important as they keep
things fair and demonstrate the setting’s internal logic But having the best game experiences depends on your interactions with
the other players, too Here are some points to consider to help make your games the best they can be:
Everyone’s invited to the fun: Be welcoming to new or inexperienced players
Off-limits: Respect people who don’t want sex/violence/horror or other uncomfortable topics in the game, and accept they don’t
have to justify why There are many very good (potentially traumatic) reasons
Consideration: Nobody’s fun should come at another’s expense
Table manners: Discuss what’s OK and not OK at the game table Eating, use of electronic devices, drinking alcohol, texting,
using social media? All of these and more are all worth discussing before play
Involve others: Don’t try to hog every scene, give everyone time in the spotlight
Teamwork: Don’t be needlessly awkward or make your character wander off alone without good reason, (splitting the group
slows down play)
Respect your GM: Let the GM worry about the rules — rules arguments are a fun killer (and you can always discuss it with
the GM after the game)
Contribute: Your actions should help progress the story and develop your character
Play the game: It’s not always about winning, it’s about the stories you tell and the fun you have Sometimes your Character
might die, accept that, and, if it happens, make it memorable and fun Also remember, sometimes, it’s just better to run away!
Good mentors: If you have younger players in your group, it is everyone’s responsibility to welcome, help, and maintain ageappropriate
behaviour
Options: Tests Above 100%
Having exceptional abilities makes it quite possible that a modified Characteristic or Skill may be 100% or higher when tested
If this occurs in your game, you may wish to use the following optional rule to help represent such an awesome figure
A successful Test gains a bonus of +1 SL for each full 10% a tested Characteristic or Skill exceeds 100%
Example: Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz has a Charm Skill of 115%: her Fellowship characteristic of 80% plus her Charm
advances of +35% (see Advances on page 47 for more on this); thus, if she succeeds at a Charm Test, she gains a bonus of +1
SL over an above what she earns by rolling or from any applicable Talents

Yes, perfectly!: The result is as good as it can be, perhaps with extra luck and fortunate
coincidences thrown in!
+4 to +5 Impressive Success Yes, and…: You achieve your goal with style, exceeding your expectations
+2 to +3 Success Yes: You achieve a solid success
+0 to +1 Marginal Success Yes, but…: You more or less achieve what you intend, but imperfectly, and perhaps with
an unpredictable side effect
–1 to –0 Marginal Failure No, but…: You marginally fail, perhaps accomplishing a portion of what you intended
–2 to –3 Failure No: You just plain do it wrong
–4 to –5 Impressive Failure No, and…: Not only do you mess up, but you also cause additional things to go wrong
-6 or less Astounding Failure No, not in any way!: Everything goes wrong in the worst possible way The GM will
likely add to your woes with unanticipated consequences of your actions Surely no-one
is this unlucky; you have clearly offended the gods
Dramatic Tests
Simply knowing if you pass or fail is not always enough; sometimes,
it is useful to know how well you succeed or how badly you fail a
Test This is especially the case when pitching your Skills against
another (see Opposed Tests), which is often the case for magic
and combat So, when you want to know exactly how well or
badly you have performed a Test, use a Dramatic Test Another
reason for choosing a Dramatic Test is when the progress of the
adventure could depend on the Test Dramatic Tests provide
outcomes rather than straight success or failure, which means
that even if the test is ‘failed’ the adventure continues, albeit
in a more challenging way than if you had achieved a success
Dramatic Tests are handled in the same way as Simple Tests, and
still provide success or failure as outcomes, but the results have
more detail This detail is governed by Success Levels
Success Levels
Success Levels (shortened to SL) are used to describe the
effectiveness of a Test To determine the SL of a Test, subtract
the 10s number of the rolled dice from the 10s number of the
Characteristic or Skill being tested, including any modifiers
(see Difficulty for more on modifiers) The higher the SL, the
better the outcome; the lower it is, the worse things have gone
Marginal results, where you succeed or fail a Test with +0 or
–0 SL, could either be interpreted as succeeding or failing by a
whisker, with minimal consequences either good or bad, or could
give inconclusive results allowing you try again
Example: Eichengard is careering across muddy fields atop his
stallion, desperately fleeing the lands of a disgruntled noble when
a wall blocks his passage He decides to push his mount to jump,
and the GM calls for a Dramatic Ride (Horse) test Eichengard
rolls 29 against his Ride (Horse) skill of 41 The 10s number of
the Skill being tested is 4, and the 10s number rolled was 2, so
the test succeeds with +2 SL (4–2=2) and he clears the wall with
space to spare Buoyed by his success, Eichengard twists around
in his saddle and makes the sign of the twin-tailed comet at
the horsemen pursuing him Unfortunately, this means he’s
not paying attention to where he’s going The GM calls for a
Dramatic Perception Test, and Eichengard’s player rolls 82,
significantly higher than Eichengard’s Perception skill of 39
The 10s number of the roll is 8, and the 10s number of the skill
being tested is 3, so the test has failed with –5 SL (3–8=–5) He
has failed rather badly As Eichengard laughs at the increasingly
distant guards sent to capture him, a low-lying branch slams
hard into his side, knocking him flying
Options: Fast SL
Determining your SL involves some simple mathematics, so
calculating it can slow play during fraught scenes Fortunately,
there is a fast way to calculate SL for those looking to keep
their games as fast as possible When you pass a Test, use
the result of the tens die as your SL So, if you passed a
Test with a roll of 36, you score +3 SL With this optional
rule, the closer you roll to your tested Skill, the better, rather
than rolling low being best If a Test fails, you calculate SL
as normal, taking your rolled tens die from your tested Skill
to determine your negative SL
V
152
Exactly how well you succeed or fail is shown in the Outcomes
Table, which can be used to inspire descriptions of what just
happened Much like simple tests offer a yes or no in answer to
‘do I succeed at this test?’, dramatic tests also provide answers,
just more of them
If you automatically succeed due to rolling 01–05 (see page 150),
you score +1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is higher
If you automatically fail due to rolling 96–00 (see page 150), you
score –1 SL or the SL you rolled, whichever is lower

Options: Criticals & Fumbles
We introduce some extra rules for Criticals and Fumbles in
Combat later in this chapter They can also be used to add
drama for all Tests, creating a game that feels epic in scope as
extreme results become commonplace If that describes your
group, you could use the following optional rule
Any Test scoring a success that also rolls a double is called a
Critical, meaning you’ve scored an Astounding Success from
the Outcome Table; and any failure including a double is a
Fumble, resulting in an Astounding Failure from the Outcome
Table This optional rule works well with Simple Tests,
providing a fun addition to the yes or no results offered there
Characteristic Tests
Sometimes you may want to do something that is not
covered by one of the Skills In these rare cases, you make
a Characteristic Test instead of a Skill Test The GM
determines the most appropriate Characteristic for what you
are attempting, and you Test it as normal
Difficulty
Not all Tests are equal Climbing a fence is laughably easy but
ascending the face of a sheer cliff is incredibly tough To represent
this, the GM assigns bonuses or penalties to Tests called the
Difficulty While published adventures define the difficulty for
the GM — for example: calling for a Hard (–20) Research test
— there are many instances where the GM has to determine
them on the fly Making judgments like this is one of the most
common functions of the GM For each Test, whether simple or
dramatic, the GM should decide the Difficulty and then consult
the Difficulty Table to determine the appropriate modifier GMs
may choose to assign even greater bonuses or penalties than those
shown on the table, but such modifiers should only be used in
extreme situations
Example: Valentyn, a Jade Magister, tries to find the tracks of
an unruly stag he is hunting Under normal circumstances, he
would perform an Average (+20) Track Test with his skill of
41, thus test against 61; however, the GM decides that as the
rain last night washed away most of the tracks the task is Very
Hard and imposes a –30 penalty Therefore, Valentyn has to roll
11 or under (41–30=11) to succeed He rolls a 35, which would
have been a success under normal circumstances, but in this
circumstance is a failure, indicating the rain has foiled the Jade
Magister’s attempt

Opposed Tests
Sometimes you match your capabilities directly against those of
an opponent The rules represent this with a special Dramatic
Test called an Opposed Test Opposed Tests are an important
part of WFRP’s combat rules later in this chapter, but are used in
many other situations, as well
An Opposed Test is handled just like any other Dramatic Test,
but both parties make a Test The party with the highest SL wins
the Test If both participants score the same SL, the party with
the higher tested Skill or Characteristic wins In the unlikely
RULES V
153
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
event there is still a tie, then one of two things, as determined by
the GM, occurs: 1) there is a stalemate, and nothing happens; 2)
both parties re-roll until there is a clear winner
Example: Having floored an important Reiklander baron
at a party, Salundra makes to leave the ballroom; however,
some uneasy guardsmen block her passage, knowing they
really should detain the noble captain Salundra scowls as she
approaches
The GM calls for an Intimidate Test and opposes it with the
guardsmen’s commanding officer’s Leadership Test Both the
player and the GM roll Salundra’s Intimidate is 47 The officer’s
Leadership is 46 Salundra rolls a 04, scoring +4 SL (4–0=4),
while the GM rolls 16, scoring +3 SL (4–1=3) As Salundra’s SL
is higher (4 to the officer’s 3), she successfully intimidates the
guards, who let her pass with barely a grumble
Like any other Tests, some Opposed Tests are easier or harder
than others, so the GM may decide modifiers are required In
most cases, these modifiers are applied equally to both sides, but
not always If no Difficulty is marked for an Opposed Test, it is
assumed to be Challenging (+0)
If it is important to know how well the winner of the Opposed
Test won, use the difference between the two results to determine
a final SL
Example: It’s Pie Week, an annual week-long festival for
everyone’s favourite baked goods, and Salundra has entered a pieeating
contest She’s reached the final, and it’s her versus Fat Tom
Brandysnap, the Ubersreik Pie Eating Champion for the last 5
years running, and a Halfling wider than he is tall
The GM calls for an Opposed Endurance Test Salundra has
an Endurance of 45 and Fat Tom has 63 Salundra is possibly
in trouble! Dice roll, and Salundra rolls 51, scoring –1 SL Sali’s
looking a little green! But Fat Tom’s looking worse! He rolls 91
for –3 SL So, even though she’s failed her Endurance roll, she
still wins the Opposed Test by 2 SL, though she’ll probably be
bringing up most of those pies later!
Extended Tests
Sometimes the adventure will call for a specific number of
Success Levels be achieved to fully succeed at a time-consuming
or especially taxing task Doing this requires a special Dramatic
Test called an Extended Test Extended Tests are handled in the
same fashion as any other Dramatic Test, but the SL scored from
multiple rolls are added together to reach a specified target If the
total SL scored ever falls below 0, you can start again from scratch
with the next roll
Example: On the run again, Molli is attempting to pick an
unexpectedly complex lock before she is discovered The GM states
the lock requires 5 Success Levels with a Challenging (+0) Pick
Lock Test to pry open, and that she only has three Rounds before
the guard arrives Molli’s Pick Lock skill is 58, so she has a good
chance of managing it, but time isn’t on her side Unfortunately for
her, her first Test scores 63: –1 SL and a terrible start, she’s made no
progress and will start from scratch next round Cursing under her
breath as footsteps draw closer, Molli tries again, this time scoring
11, for +4 SL! She feels tension in her picks as the lock almost
springs, but she also hears the approaching guard is even closer
The GM explains the next Test is the last one before the guard
arrives, so Molli can either abandon her attempt and avoid the
guard or make a desperate effort to secure the last SL she needs
V
to pick the lock Knowing she needs to escape, Molli risks the last
Test and rolls, scoring… 42! That’s +1 SL, taking her to a total of
5 The lock opens with a click! Triumphant, Molli slips through
the door and closes it behind her just before the guard arrives
Options:
Extended Tests and 0 SL
Rolling 0 SL in an Extended Test does not benefit or hinder
the running SL total, which can feel a little odd given you
either passed or failed the Test, and that should perhaps come
with some advantage or penalty If this is an issue for you, use
the following optional rule A successful Test adds a minimum
of +1 SL to the cumulative total, and a failed Test removes a
minimum of –1 SL from the total
Assistance
In some situations, multiple Characters working together have a
better chance of completing a task than a Character attempting it
alone With the GM’s permission, a Character can assist another
Character who is about to take a Test When doing so, the
Character with the best chance to succeed rolls the dice
Each Character assisting provides a bonus of +10 to the Test
Other than that, the Test is rolled as normal
Limits on Assistance
Characters can assist each other in most tasks; however, there
are limits
	 To assist you require at least 1 Advance in the Skill being
tested
	 Assisting Characters must normally be adjacent to the
Character taking the Test
	 You may not assist on Tests made to resist disease, poison,
fear, hazards, or anything else the GM deems inappropriate
	 You may not be assisted by more Characters than you have
in the appropriate Characteristic Bonus (see page 33)
Example: Adhemar, Perdita, and Valentyn hastily search a room
when its owner, an aging merchant, leaves to find some records
The GM declares a Difficult (–10) Perception Test is required
Since Perdita and Valentyn both have the Perception Skill and are
helping, Adhemar (who has the highest Perception Skill, at 59)
gains a bonus of +20 to his Perception Test, for a combined total
of 69 (59–10+20=69) However, he rolls 74, and fails, meaning
all three characters have failed to find anything useful before the
hobbling merchant returns
Options: Combining Skills
Sometimes, you may be in a situation where you feel two
Skills should be tested by the same character for a single task,
so it may be appropriate to combine those Skills for a single
Test There are generally two reasons to do this: 1) is faster
and limits the number of dice rolls required to press on with
the game; 2) having to pass two Tests in a row to perform a
single task significantly reduces your chance of passing overall
The simplest way to do this is to attempt both Skills with one
Test, comparing a single percentile roll to each Skill number
If both pass, you succeed at the Test If only one passes, you
partially pass as appropriate And, obviously, if both fail, you
have failed the Test
Example: After a string of unlikely events, Salundra finds herself
on-stage in yellow and red tights, singing and dancing in the
Vargr Breughel Memorial Playhouse’s inaugural production
of ‘Tell Me On A Festag’ The GM calls for a Challenging
Combined Perform (Dance) and Entertain (Sing) Test, thinking
it unfair Salundra should have to enact each Test in turn as
that would significantly reduce her overall chance of success
Salundra has Perform (Dance) at 53 from her time in court,
but doesn’t have Entertain (Sing), so must use her Fellowship
of 43 She then rolls 46, meaning she managed the dance
(succeeded with +1 SL), but hit a few off-notes with her
singing (failed at -0 SL) — not perfect, but good enough
for the gathered crowds; though Kym Neumann, the Altdorf
Spieler’s theatre critic, may not be writing a favourable review
RULES V
155
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Combat
Sooner or later you will need to stop someone in their tracks,
or someone will try to stop you When diplomacy fails, is not
attempted, or is not understood as a basic concept, Combat
begins!
In Combat, lots of individuals take actions in a short space of
time, many of them in direct opposition to each other You will
still be taking Tests to resolve these actions, but timing and a host
of other factors become more important, so we have some rules
to make everything work
Timing
In Combat, the exact timing of actions matters more, so time is
organised into:
	 Rounds: A Round is enough time for all characters to attempt
a Test and move into position It’s normally a just few seconds,
the GM can decide exactly how long if necessary
	 Turns: During a Round, each combatant has a Turn to
perform an Action and a Move
	 Initiative Order: Each combatant usually takes their Turn
in order of their Initiative Characteristic, from highest to
lowest
Combat Summary
Combat follows these steps until one side flees or is defeated:
1 Determine Surprise: The GM determines if any characters
are Surprised This normally only happens on the first round
of combat See the section below
2 Round Begins: If the rules call for something to happen at
the start of the Round, it happens now
3 Characters Take Turns: Each combatant takes a Turn in
Initiative order, starting with the highest Initiative Each
Character can normally perform a Move and an Action on
their Turn (see page 157)
4 Round Ends: The Round ends when all combatants have
taken a Turn If the rules call for something to happen at the
end of the Round, it happens now
5 Repeat Steps 2–5 As Required: Continue to play through
Rounds until the combat is resolved
Initiative Order
Combatants act in Initiative order during the Round, with the
highest Initiative acting first, until all involved have taken a Turn
If you want this to work quickly at the table, have the players sit in
Initiative order If multiple combatants have the same Initiative,
they act in order from the highest Agility to the lowest If they
also have the same Agility, then roll an Opposed Agility Test,
with the winner choosing who goes first for the combat Some
Talents impact combat order (see Chapter 4: Skills and Talents)
Example: Tollich, with an Initiative of 38, always acts ahead of
his companion, Perdita who has an Initiative of 33 If they attack
a coven of cultists, each with Initiative 35, the combat order
would be: Tollich (38), the Cultists (35), Perdita (33)
Roll For Initiative!
Some groups prefer to randomise Initiative There are several
ways to do this, choose your favourite:
 Each character rolls an Initiative Test to determine a
SL
 Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Initiative
 Each character rolls 1d10 and adds it to their Agility
Bonus + Initiative Bonus
The GM notes the results in decreasing numerical order and uses
this as the Initiative Order You could use this order for every
Round (quickest option) or roll each Round (gives some variety to
the order; slow characters have the chance to not always go last)
Rounds Outside Combat
Out of combat, the exact timing of those actions is usually
flexible Sometimes it is helpful to use Rounds outside of
Combat to help organise everyone’s contributions; for
example, Extended Tests happen over several rounds, with one
Test taken each Round (see page 154)
Surprise
Taking your enemy by surprise gives you a big advantage If
one side is planning an attack, they can attempt to harness the
element of surprise by:
	 Hiding: Make a successful Stealth Test in appropriate cover
Characters may oppose this with a Perception Test if they
are wary, or if the GM is feeling generous
V
156
	 Sneaky Tactics: Attack from behind, in the dark, through
heavy fog, or from above! The GM may allow a Perception
Test to spot the incoming attackers if appropriate
	 Distractions: Loud bangs, milling crowds and an especially
engaging sermon are just some of the distractions that could
harbour a surprise attack!
	 Unprepared Defenders: If the enemy are particularly
unwary, the attackers automatically surprise their victims
	 Something Else: Other sneaky and ingenious plans
concocted by cunning players — the GM has the final call
on the possibility of surprise
Surprise Talents!
Even in situations where the GM states there is no chance of
spotting incoming ambushers, some Talents allow Surprise to
be avoided See Chapter 4: Skill and Talents for more on this
Example: Tollich and Perdita fall foul of an ambush by goresmeared
Cultists of the Blood God The combat begins when
the Cultists storm from their hiding places, revealing their
positions The GM decides Tollich and Perdita are surprised
as they were having a vigorous debate, and neither was at all
prepared for an ambush However, Tollich has the Combat
Aware Talent, which grants a Challenging (+0) Perception Test
to avoid Surprise; for Tollich, this is 41 He rolls 23, showing
his well-honed instincts have spotted something is wrong So,
for the first round, only Perdita takes the Surprised Condition;
Tollich and the Cultists act as normal
If there is a chance the ambushers will be spotted, the GM will
typically call for Opposed Stealth vs Perception Test, usually
with the character with the worst Stealth opposing all potential
spotters If the ambusher wins, each defeated character gains
the Surprised Condition (see page 169)
If no-one is surprised, proceed with the combat as normal
If anyone is surprised, they can use a Resolve point to remove the
Surprised Condition (see page 169)
Taking Your Turn
Combat is a dynamic, disorientating experience, with friend and
foe desperately weaving around each other, blades flashing as
thrust follows parry follows gunshot
The GM describes the situation — where everyone is, what your
surroundings are like — and you can ask for more details to flesh
things out and help plan your action ‘How thick is the chandelier
rope? Could an arrow cut it?’, for example When it’s your Turn,
you’ll make your Move and take Action!
On your Turn you have a Move and an Action, you can take
these in any order — it’s presumed you are probably doing both at
the same time, and you can freely describe them as one combined
manoeuvre You can also skip taking an Action or Move, though
you won’t get another opportunity until the next Round!
Vivid descriptions of what you do will bring the Combat to life
Rather than declare your action is, ‘hit the Goblin’, it’s much more
fun to say, ‘I Kick the chair in front of me towards the Goblins
and lunge with my sword at the closest one’s throat’ You never
know, the GM might reward you with the odd bonus for great
roleplaying This goes for the resolution of your Action too — the
GM will describe the outcome, but you can certainly embellish it!
RULES V
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Move
In most circumstances, exact distances don’t matter too much
Use your Movement Characteristic as a guide to the ground
you can cover, and the GM will let you know if the move will
take more than one Turn Reaching difficult places, perhaps by
climbing or jumping, will also use your Action if you need to Test
a Skill to get there (perhaps with a Climb or Athletics Test)
If you are not already fighting someone, you can also use your
Move to Charge into close combat, gaining +1 Advantage (see
page 164) For more on this, and for a detailed breakdown of
movement speeds, leaping distances, and more, see Moving on
page 164
Action
In combat, your Action is used to do something Whether that’s
swing a sword at a Mutant, jump from rooftop to rooftop, or take
a moment to gauge the situation, that’s up to you Your Action is
only limited by your imagination, the physical constraints of the
fight location and the capabilities of your Character
Describe what you want your Character to do The GM will then
tell you if you need to make a Test to succeed at your planned
Action The results will then be narrated by you and the GM,
ending your Action
For a detailed breakdown of how to use your Action to attack
another Character, refer to Attacking If you would like to use
prayers or magic, refer to either Chapter 7: Religion and Belief
or Chapter 8: Magic Chapter 4: Skills and Talents also contains
many examples of how to use your Skills during combat
Example: Molli looks on nervously from behind a barrel as
Salundra is beset by the flying fists of three pub brawlers keen to
put the young captain in her place On her Turn, Molli’s player
asks if the pub has an upper floor The GM confirms it does, and
that it has a balcony overlooking the fight Smiling, the player
declares Molli will sprint upstairs and push a table down on
the fight to help break it up using both her Move and Action
Given the upper floor isn’t far away, the GM decides Molli can
get there in a single Round but pushing the small table there
will take a little effort
The GM calls for an Average (+20) Athletics Test to heft the table
over the balcony Molli’s Athletics is 34, so she needs to roll 54 or
under She rolls 21, for +3 SL, and the table flies! Molli shouts out
as the table tips: ‘Stop fighting!’ The GM states all combatants
below must perform an Opposed Dodge Test against the +3 SL
or be hit by the table Unfortunately, only Salundra fails this, and
the table lands squarely on her head…
Free Actions
Some things you’ll want your Character to do won’t count as your
Action for the round — such as shouting a warning, drawing
your weapon, or drinking a potion It’s the GM’s decision on
what takes up your Action, and what you can do in a Round A
good general guide is that if an act requires you to make a Test, it
is an Action rather than a Free Action
Options: On The Defensive
What if you want to prepare to dodge or parry incoming blows,
to hold a defensive position in a doorway, or use Language
(Magick) to deploy an array of dispels? As your Action, choose
a Skill to use defensively and you will get +20 to defensive Tests
using the Skill until the start of your next Turn
Attacking
One of the most common Actions is to attack an opponent
To make a ranged attack, your weapon must be in range (see
Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide for weapon ranges) and your
target visible in line-of-sight For melee attacks, you must be
adjacent your target with a weapon ready (see Engaged)
Default Combat Difficulty
During combat, all Difficulty is assumed to be Challenging
(+0) So, if no Difficulty is expressly mentioned in the rules,
use Challenging
1: Roll to Hit
Melee: To attack, perform an Opposed Melee Test with your
Opponent (both you and your opponent Test your Melee Skill —
see page 126) Whoever scores the highest SL wins If you win
the Test, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage If you
lose the Opposed Test, your opponent gains +1 Advantage and
your Action is finished
V
158
Ranged: Roll a Ranged Test for the weapon you’re using If you
are successful, you hit your opponent and gain +1 Advantage
If you fail, your Action is over Your opponent doesn’t gain
Advantage in ranged combat
In both melee and ranged Combat, it’s possible to score an
impressive hit called a Critical, or to make a mistake, called a
Fumble See Criticals and Fumbles in the section below
Summary: Test to hit your opponent with your weapon This Test
is Opposed in melee Any winner gains +1 Advantage
2: Determine Hit Location
If you successfully hit, find out where — reverse the roll to hit
and compare this number to the Hit Locations table So, a roll of
23 to hit would become 32 on the table, a hit on the Right Arm
Creatures with different body shapes may use different hit
location tables Refer to Chapter 12: Bestiary for more on the
different Hit Location tables
Hit Locations
Roll Location
01–09 Head
10–24
Left Arm
(or Secondary Arm)
25–44 Right Arm
(or Primary Arm)
45–79 Body
80–89 Left Leg
90–00 Right Leg
Summary: Reverse your ‘Roll to hit’ Test result to determine a
Hit Location
3: Determine Damage
Once you have determined the hit location, it is time to work
out how much Damage you deal Each weapon has a Weapon
Damage characteristic (see page 293) This is usually your
modified Strength Bonus for melee weapons, or a fixed number
for ranged weapons Take the SL of your Opposed Test and add
it to the Weapon Damage of the weapon you’re using This final
number is your Damage
Summary: Damage = Weapon Damage + SL
4: Apply Damage
Using the Damage and the Hit Location you struck, you now
see how many Wounds your opponent loses from your attack
Subtract your opponent’s Toughness Bonus and any Armour
Points protecting the Hit Location from your Damage The
remaining Damage is suffered as Wounds by your opponent If
this is 1 or less, your opponent has shrugged off the worst of the
attack and only loses 1 Wound Should the Wounds lost exceed
your opponent’s remaining Wounds total, your opponent takes a
Critical Wound (see page 172) and gains the Prone Condition
(see page 169)
Summary: Wounds Suffered = Damage – opponent’s (Toughness
Bonus + Armour Points)
Opposing a melee Attack
You can Oppose an incoming melee attack with more than
just your Melee Skill The most obvious choice is Dodge,
which allows you to avoid incoming blows, but Chapter 4:
Skills and Talents lists many other Skills that just might be
useful in combat, including Intimidate, Charm, Leadership,
and more If your GM thinks it’s appropriate for the
situation, and you’re happy missing out on the opportunity
to score a Critical Hit against your opponent, then why not
give it a go
Engaged
Whenever you attack an opponent, or are attacked, in melee
combat, you count as Engaged This means you are tussling with
each other in a fight, and others rules (due to Talents, Spells, etc)
for being Engaged might apply If you don’t attack each other for
a full Round, you are no longer Engaged
Success Levels in Combat
In combat, SL is used to determine damage, rather than
getting a result from the Outcome Table To mix this up a
little, Tests in combat also use Criticals and Fumbles
Criticals and Fumbles
During the cut and thrust of combat, accidents, mistakes, and
moments of extraordinary skill can happen in quick succession
To represent the unpredictable extremes of a life-or-death
skirmish, there are Criticals — extraordinarily good hits — and
Fumbles — egregious errors
Criticals
Any successful Melee or Ranged Test that also rolls a double causes
a Critical This means you have dealt a significant blow, and it even
happens when you are the defender in an opposed Test
RULES V
159
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
If you score a Critical, your opponent receives an immediate
Critical Wound as your weapon strikes true See page 172 for
more on what this means Beyond that, SL is calculated as normal,
as is who wins any Opposed Tests
Options: Deathblow
Some players like a heroic approach to combat, with characters
able to wade through lesser foes If this suits your style of
play, use the following rule:
If you kill a melee opponent in a single blow, you may
move into the space the character occupied and attack another
opponent if there is one available You may keep doing this a
number of times equal to your Weapon Skill Bonus, and may
not attack the same Character more than once on the same
Turn Some creatures (see Chapter 12: Bestiary) are so big they
can activate this rule without killing any opponents
Opposed Tests
and Fumbles
During an Opposed Test, it is possible to Fumble and still
win if you score a higher SL than your opponent This is
fine, and not a little hilarious, as you ineffectually tussle with
your even worse opponent, potentially injuring yourself in the
process
Example: Molli swipes her dagger at her opponent and rolls
66 for a fumble with -3 SL, but her opponent rolls 92 for -5
SL So, Molli wins with +2 SL over her opponent, gaining
+1 Advantage, which she may quickly lose as she also has to
roll on the Oops! Table to see what unfortunate accident will
befall her
Fumbles
The converse of Criticals, any failed combat Test that also rolls
a double is a Fumble, which means something very unfortunate
has occurred To determine what happens, roll on the Oops!
Table
Oops! Table
Roll Result
01–20 You catch a part of your anatomy (we
recommend you play this for laughs) — lose
1 Wound, ignoring Toughness Bonus or
Armour Points
21–40 Your melee weapon jars badly, or ranged
weapon malfunctions or slightly breaks –
your weapon suffers 1 Damage Next round,
you will act last regardless of Initiative order,
Talents, or special rules as you recover (see
page 156)
41–60 Your manoeuvre was misjudged, leaving you
out of position, or you lose grip of a ranged
weapon Next round, your Action suffers a
penalty of –10
61–70 You stumble badly, finding it hard to right
yourself Lose your next Move
71–80 You mishandle your weapon, or you drop
your ammunition Miss your next Action
81–90 You overextend yourself or stumble and twist
your ankle Suffer a Torn Muscle (Minor)
injury (see page 179) This counts as a
Critical Wound
91–00 You completely mess up, hitting 1 random
ally in range using your rolled units die to
determine the SL of the hit If that’s not
possible, you somehow hit yourself in the
face and gain a Stunned Condition (see page
169)
Misfires!
If you are using a Blackpowder, Engineering, or Explosive
weapon, and roll a Fumble that is also an even number — 00,
88, and so on — your weapon Misfires, exploding in your
hand You take full Damage to your Primary Arm location
using the units die as an effective SL for the hit, and your
weapon is destroyed
Ranged Combat
There are some extra considerations that apply to ranged attacks:
	 Ranged attacks cannot be opposed with Melee Skills unless
you have a large enough shield (see page 298), or if they
are at Point Blank range (see page 297), where it is also
allowable to Dodge
V
160
	 You cannot make ranged attacks whilst Engaged, unless you
are armed with a ranged weapon that has the Pistol Quality
(see Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide)
	 If you use your Ranged Skill when you are Engaged with
your target, the target may Oppose your attack with any
Melee Skill
Combat Difficulty
Combat Tests can be modified in the same manner as other Tests
These modifiers can be used to reflect the effects of terrain, the
weather, and a variety of other factors The following are some
of the most common modifiers encountered in combat For
situations not covered here, use these as a guide Remember, the
GM has final say about the difficulty of any particular Test
RULES V
161

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Combining Difficulties
There will be instances where multiple factors make taking
a particular action more difficult than normal Lurking in a
gloomy forest as you attempt to shoot at a distant opponent
through the trees is harder than shooting at the same opponent
on a bright day in an open field When combining multiple
difficulties, use the following guidelines:
 If the situation would apply two or more penalties,
simply add the modifiers together to a maximum of –30
or Very Hard For example, fog and aiming for a specific
body part both make Weapon Skill Tests Hard (–20)
When combined, the Test would simply be Very Hard
(–30), rather than suffer a –40 modifier Similarly, if
the situation would apply two or more bonuses, add the
modifiers together to a maximum of +60 or Very Easy
 If the situation would apply a penalty and a bonus, add
them together to find the new difficulty Attacking an
opponent while standing in deep snow normally requires
a Very Hard (–30) Test But attacking an opponent who
is Prone requires an Easy (+20) Test In a situation where
both apply, the Test would be Difficult (–10) since –30
plus +20 equals –10
Special cases
Helpless Targets
Melee Tests made to hit a sleeping, unconscious, or otherwise
helpless target automatically succeed Check the Unconscious
Condition for more on this (on page 169)
Shooting into a Group
Ranged Tests made to hit a group of targets are Average (+20)
if there is 3-6 of them, Easy (+40) if there are 7-12 of them, and
Very Easy (+60) if there is 13 or more of them Any successful
hits are randomised between all likely targets as the GM prefers
Outnumbering
If you out-number an opponent 2 to 1, you gain a bonus of +20 to
hit your opponent in melee combat If you outnumber an enemy
by 3 to 1, you get an even larger bonus of +40 to hit Further,
at the end of every Round, all outnumbered opponents lose 1
Advantage Outnumbering is generally determined by how many
Characters are Engaged with each other; if there is any doubt, the
GM decides who is outnumbering whom
Options: Shooting into Melee
For most, simply choosing a target and rolling to hit is
enough of a complication However, some prefer the rules be
more precise when firing at an engaged target If this is you,
use the following rules:
There may be times when you wish to shoot a target already
Engaged with one or more allied targets Ballistic Skill Tests
against these opponents are resolved as normal, but suffer a
penalty of –20 to hit as you try your best to hit your specified
target (if you do not care whom you hit, you actually gain
a bonus of +20 to +60 to hit, see Shooting into a Group)
If you would have hit the target were it not for the penalty,
you instead hit one of the target’s opponents, as determined
randomly by the GM
Size
Size is an important factor when shooting at a target: it is far
easier to hit a barn door than an apple For more on Size, refer to

Two-Weapon Fighting
Some  warriors  prefer to fight with a weapon in each  hand —
such as using a sword and sword-breaker, or a sword and a shield
The following applies when you are fighting with two weapons 
	 You may use any one-handed close combat weapon
or any pistol when fighting with two weapons 
	 You may use either hand to make an attack Attacks made
using your secondary  hand  suffer  a –20  penalty  to any
applicable Test 
	 If you have the Dual Wielder Talent  you may  be able
to  attack with both weapons See  Chapter 4: Skills and
Talents for more on this 
Scatter
On a failed Ranged (Throwing) Test, roll 1d10 and consults the
following diagram to see where your weapon lands ‘T’ marks the
target
1 2 3
4 T 5
6 7 8
A roll of 1-8 provides a direction: roll 2d10 to determine the
distance the weapon scatters in yards — it scatters no more than
half the distance between you and the target A roll of 9 and the
weapon lands at your feet A 10, and it lands at your target’s feet
Scatter can be used whenever a random direction is required
Unarmed Combat
Not every fight in  WFRP  involves  guns or swords
Many  conflicts  are  settled  with good,  old-fashioned  fisticuffs
A successful Melee (Brawling) Test for unarmed combat is handled
in the same way as any other combat Test, but you have one extra
option: you may enter a Grapple!
Grappling 
Instead of inflicting damage with an unarmed attack, you can
attempt to Grapple and  immobilise your opponent You must
declare this is your intent before rolling to hit your opponent If
you win the Opposed Test, you and your opponent are Grappling,
and your opponent gains the Entangled Condition If you begin
your turn Grappling, you may break the Grapple if you have a
higher Advantage than your opponent, and do not count as being
Engaged for your Move; otherwise, you must make an Opposed
Strength Test for your Action If you win, you can do one of the
following:
	 Deal SB + SL Damage using your Strength roll to determine
the Hit Location affected You ignore any Armour Points as
you wrench arms and pull muscles
	 Either: 1) Give your opponent an Entangled Condition, or
2) Remove an Entangled Condition from yourself, plus lose
an extra one for each SL by which you win
If you lose the Opposed Test, you can do nothing but struggle as
your opponent gains +1 Advantage
Those outside the Grapple gain a +20 bonus to hit the grapplers
with the lowest Advantage, and a +10 bonus to hit to the grappler
with the highest Advantage 
Options:
Grappling With Ski lls
If you are Grappling, your GM may allow you to perform
a Test other than an Opposed Strength Test according to
the situation Perhaps Language (Magick) to cast a spell, or
Charm to wheedle your way free, or Leadership to order your
grappler to stand down? As long as your GM is happy with
this, roll those dice and see what happens But if you fail, note
that you will not be concentrating on the Grapple, so the GM
may rule you gain an extra Entangled Condition, which could
make things very tricky!
Mounted Combat
Riding into Combat, sword swinging, guns blazing, is not only
terrifying for those on the receiving end, it also brings bonuses
to the rider Mounted Combat uses the same rules as any other
Combat, with the following additions:
	 For the purposes of your Move, riders count as having the
Movement Attribute of their mount Further, riders take
Ride Tests for any tests to Run, Jump or similar, and use
their mount’s Movement Attribute
	 Any melee attack from a Rider on a target smaller than their
Mount gains a bonus of +20 to hit
	 If you are rolling to hit a mounted character, you choose
whether to hit the rider or the mount If you are in close
combat, you also suffer a penalty of –10 to your Melee Test
if you target the rider and are smaller than the mount (see
Size on page 162)
	 A Mount without the Skittish Trait (see page 342) is
effectively another combatant, and may use its own Action
to attack Engaged targets
	 When Charging, you may use the Strength and Size rules of
your mount for the purposes of calculating Damage
	 When riding, you suffer a penalty of –20 to any attempts to
use the Dodge Skill unless you have the Trick Riding Talent
Note: Most mounts are bigger than Characters, meaning they
may cause Fear or Terror, and gain other combat advantages as
explained on page 341
RULES V
163
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Advantage
Advantage represents your momentum in combat, and is gained
when you outwit, defeat, or otherwise dominate your opponents
It is recorded with tokens — be these coins, cards, chits, counters,
or specially designed Advantage tokens — or by a tally sheet on
scrap paper
Options: Limiting Advantage
Some GMs prefer a more controlled combat environment
that isn’t so influenced by the whimsy of dice and luck As
Advantage can swing wildly during the course of a battle,
and can have a significant impact, consider using one of the
following optional rules if you wish to contain this:
 Advantage has an upper level equal to each Character’s
Initiative Bonus
 Cap Advantage at a pre-arranged limit, such as 2, 4,
or more 10 also works well as you can easily track it
with 1d10
Gaining Advantage
Advantage is secured each time you win an Opposed Test in
combat, you assess the battlefield using your Skills, or when your
spirits are lifted The following provides some examples of this,
but is far from exhaustive, and the GM is encouraged to hand out
Advantage tokens as suits the circumstances
	 Surprise: Attacking Surprised enemies brings +1
Advantage See page 169
	 Charging: Charging headlong into combat grants +1
Advantage See page 165
	 Assess: If you use one of your Skills to secure a tactical
advantage, gain +1 Advantage See individual Skill
descriptions in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents for more
details concerning this
	 Victory: Whenever you defeat an important NPC, gain
+1 Advantage Subduing a party nemesis may grant +2
Advantage
	 Winning: If you win an Opposed Test during combat gain
+1 Advantage
	 Outmanouevre: If you wound an opponent without
engaging in an Opposed Test, gain +1 Advantage
There is also an array of Talents that secure Advantage Refer to
Chapter 4: Skills and Talents for more on this
Benefits of Advantage
Each Advantage you secure adds +10 to any appropriate combat
Test or Psychology Test (see Psychology on page 190) Thus, if
you have 5 Advantage tokens, you have an impressive +50 bonus
to hit, defend, and resist the influence of others
Losing Advantage
If you lose an Opposed Test during combat, suffer any Conditions
(see page 167), or lose any Wounds, you automatically lose all
Advantage Further, should the combat end, all Advantage you’ve
gained is lost Lastly, if you have accrued no Advantage for
the Round, or end the Round outnumbered, you lose 1 point
Advantage can also be used to Disengage from combat (see page
165) There are also Skills and Talents that cause you to lose
Advantage, or transfer Advantage to another character For more
on these, read Chapter 4: Skills and Talents
Moving
The amount of detail needed for movement depends on how
you track where everyone is Many prefer to use the ‘theatre
of the mind’ method, where you describe relative positions and
distance, and the GM adjudicates if it’s possible to undertake
the Move or Action each player describes Even during tightly
controlled combat Rounds, it is usually enough to narrate how
your character negotiates the frenetic action, leaping barrels,
sprinting for cover, or dancing around opponents as required
V
164
Other groups use floorplans, grids, tokens, and Citadel
Miniatures to represent where the combatants are standing, and
this method needs a bit more specific information on distance
and movement If you do this, we recommend a 1-inch grid,
with each square representing a distance of 2 yards in the game
world This means if you have Movement 4, you can normally
move 4 squares Humans, Mutants, and other similarly-sized
creatures occupy a single square on the map Larger creatures
can take up 2, 4, or even more squares, according to their Size
trait (see page 341) If you prefer to go gridless, keep the 1
Movement = 2 yards scale
Moving During Combat
The Movement Table shows how many yards you can normally
move in a single Turn, either Walking or Running, without
having to make an Athletics Test to sprint Doing this will use
your Move for your Turn
Movement Table
Movement Walk (yards) Run (yards)
0 0 0
1 2 4
2 4 8
3 6 12
4 8 16
5 10 20
6 12 24
7 14 28
8 16 32
9 18 36
10 20 40
Charging
If you are not Engaged in combat already, you can use your Move
to Charge If you Charge, your Action must be a Melee Test
to attack an opponent If your opponent is at least your Move
characteristic in yards away before you Charge, but within your
Run range (see the Run entry in the Movement Table for how far
you can move when Charging), you will also gain +1 Advantage
as you barrel into your opponent
Disengaging
If you are Engaged in combat (see page 159), and no longer wish
to be trading blows with your opponent, you have the following
two options for leaving combat safely
Use Advantage: If you have more Advantage than your
opponents, you are in a superior position and can easily
manoeuvre yourself beyond reach If you choose to drop your
Advantage to 0, you can move away from your opponents
without penalty, perhaps choosing to Charge a new target, run
away as fast as possible, or backstep a little and fire a pistol in an
opponent’s face!
Use Dodge: If you have lower or equal Advantage to your
opponents or do not wish to spend your Advantage, you are
pinned in place If you wish to escape, you will need to use your
Action to make an Opposed Dodge/Melee Test If you succeed,
you gain +1 Advantage, and can use your Move to go anywhere
you wish using the normal rules If you fail, each opponent
defeating you gains +1 Advantage and makes it impossible for
you to escape without a blow to your back
Fleeing
If you cannot escape otherwise, you can turn your back and flee
as your Move Often, Fleeing is involuntary, caused by Terror (see
page 191) or magic
If you flee, your opponent immediately gains 1 Advantage and
may attempt 1 free attack The free attack is an unopposed Melee
Test using whatever weapon is currently held, using the SL scored
to Damage you as normal As you are throwing caution to the wind,
your opponent gains +20 to hit you If you are hit, your opponent
gains +1 Advantage, and you must enact a Challenging (+0) Cool
Test: if failed, gain a Broken Condition, and a further +1 Broken
condition per SL below 0 Once the free attack is concluded, you
may move up to your Run Movement (see the Movement Table)
directly away from your opponent, assuming you still can
Running
On your turn, you can use your Action to sprint This requires
an Average (+20) Athletics Test, and the distance covered is in
addition to your Move this round You sprint your Run movement
+ SL in yards (see the Movement Table for your Run movement)
So, a character with Move 4 who rolled –2 SL would sprint an
additional 14 yards (16–2=14)
Climbing
Most climb moves won’t need Tests Climbing rules are only
required when the Climb is difficult or if knowing exactly how
long you take to ascend is important
Climbing a ladder or similarly easy-to-climb surface does not
require a Test but does slow you down You move at half rate up
or down ladders or other easily climbed surfaces So, it would cost
4 yards of your Movement to climb a 2-yard ladder If you want
to climb more quickly, spend your Action to make an Average
(+20) Climb Test You will Climb an extra Movement + SL yards
So, a character with Movement 4 who rolled +2 SL will climb an
additional 6 yards (4+2=6)
If both hands are free, you can climb a surface with suitable
handholds with a Climb Test using your Action for the turn
You ascend or descend at a rate of ½ Movement + SL in yards
RULES V
165
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Climbing difficulty is set by the GM and varies with the nature
of the climbed surface Some climbs will be beyond the ability
of most characters without the Scale Sheer Surface Talent (see
page 144)
Leaping, and Falling
Jumping to reach high ledges, leaping from rooftop to rooftop, or
failing both and plummeting to your death are all essential parts
of the WFRP experience
Simple Athletics Tests, or perhaps a Perform (Acrobatics) Test,
will be enough to determine the outcome on most occasions, but
sometimes knowing exactly how high you jump, how far you leap,
or what happens when you fall is useful
Leaping
You can leap your Movement in feet without having to make a
Test If you want to jump farther, this takes an Average (+20)
Athletics Test if you have a run up of at least your Movement in
yards; if you do not, the Test is Challenging (+0) On a success,
each SL adds an extra foot to the leap If you succeeded with +0
SL, you manage an extra 6 inches with your jump
Falling
When falling, you suffer 1d10 Damage, plus 3 Damage for every
yard you fall Any suffered Damage is reduced by your Toughness
Bonus, but not any Armour Points you may be wearing
If you are purposefully falling — or, if you prefer, jumping
downwards — you can attempt an Average (+20) Athletics Test
to lessen the damage you may sustain If successful, you count as
having fallen 1 less yard, plus an extra yard less per SL scored
If you reduce the distance you count as having fallen to 0 or less,
you will suffer no Damage from the fall
If more Wounds are suffered from a fall than your Toughness
Bonus, you also gain the Prone Condition
Pursuit
Desperate chase scenes through busy markets and high-speed
pursuits hanging from the back of careening coaches are the
centrepiece of many exciting adventures Here’s how to run a
pursuit:
1: Determine Distance — The GM decides how far ahead the
pursued are from the pursuers, and assigns a number to represent
the size of the head start, called the Distance Typically, this will
range from 1 for those almost in reach, to 4 for those with a good
lead, to 8 for those almost beyond reach when the pursuit begins
2: Test — Everyone actively moving in the pursuit rolls a Test
for their movement — typically this will be a Drive, Ride, or
Athletics Test depending upon the circumstances
3: Update Distance — The lowest SL of the pursued and the
highest SL of the pursuers is compared, the difference between
these is added to the Distance if the pursued won, and subtracted
from the Distance number if the pursuers won
4: Determine Outcome — If the Distance falls to 0 or less, the
pursuers have caught their quarry! The pursued can then sacrifice
their slowest member that Round to delay the pursuers as the rest
continue to flee, or they can stop and confront their pursuers If
the slowest of the pursued is abandoned, the pursuers decide who
stops to confront the unfortunate and who continues in pursuit
If the poor abandoned runner is not a priority target it’s quite
likely the pursuers will continue their pursuit of their target If
Distance reaches 10+, the pursuers have lost their quarry and
the pursuit is over… for now! If the Distance is still 1–9, the
pursuit continues, return to step 2
As each Round passes, it’s important to describe what just
happened in a fun and exciting fashion If you score a large SL,
describe people getting out of the way, giving you an opportunity
to make ground If you score a negative SL, describe tripping
over crates, running into people, or slamming your coach against
a wall, slowing you down
Example: Eichengard and Sigrid are chasing three cultists
through the streets of Altdorf The cultists got a decent head
start, so the GM gives him a lead of Distance 2 Each character
rolls an Athletics Test to start the pursuit Sigrid scores +3 SL;
the cultists score +0, +2, and +2 SL; and Eichengard scores +2
SL
So, after the first round, the difference between the slowest
cultist (0) and the fastest pursuing character (Sigrid with 3) is
3, meaning that the characters catch up with the cultists The
cowardly cultists abandon their slowest member in the hope of
saving their hides, and Sigrid stops to subdue the abandoned
aberrant
Next round the cultists start at a Distance of 1 (the difference
between the next slowest cultist and Sigrid last round) so
Eichengard just needs to beat them by +1 SL to catch up again
Movement Modifiers
If some of the characters in the pursuit have a higher Movement,
they gain a bonus SL equal to the difference in Movement So, if
you had Move 5 and you were chasing a Move 4 character, you
would gain +1 SL on your pursuit roll
Example: Perdita is urging her horse forwards, trying to chase
down two Bandits Her horse has Movement 8, where the
Bandits are on Movement 7 and Movement 9 horses Thus, the
first Bandit has an unmodified Test, Perdita gains a bonus of +1
SL, and the second Bandit gains a bonus of +2 SL when they all
roll their Ride (Horse) Tests
V
166
Options:
Chase Complication
The Pursuit rules are more than enough for a fast, fun chase
scene However, for those looking to add more detail, consider
the following two options, and embellish them as required
Dodge that!: Each round, the character who rolled the highest
SL can create an Obstacle An Obstacle could be pulling a
pile of barrels into the path of a pursuer, or perhaps calling
out for help to catch someone running away The winner
chooses one Character: that Character suffers a penalty of –1
SL next round as they have to deal with the Obstacle Make
sure to take time to describe exactly what has happened to
keep the chase entertaining
Consider the Environment: Perhaps there is a bridge coming
up? Or a gap to jump? Or a fence to leap over? Or a city
gate to pass through? The GM can throw in different Tests as
the Rounds progress, mixing up the requirement each round
So, Round 1 may need an Athletics Test as everyone runs,
Round 2 may require a Leadership or Intimidate Test to pass
through a guarded gate, Round 3 may need another Athletics
Test to jump a small stream, and Round 4 may be sprint
across an open field (modified by Movement again)
Conditions
Conditions represent the effects of things that can happen to
you in the course of your adventures The Conditions you suffer
from can be recorded on a scrap sheet of paper, or you can use
chits or counters to represent them Each Condition explains
how long any effects usually last in its description; however, it’s
possible the cause of a Condition — such as a spell or critical
wound — may override this Note: If you suffer any Conditions,
you immediately lose all Advantage (see page 164)
Multiple Conditions
You can be subject to the same Condition more than once;
indeed, sometimes you will receive multiples of the same
Condition from a single event If this occurs, any penalties
suffered are stacked So, if you have three Bleeding Conditions,
you’re losing a worrying 3 Wounds per Round; or if you have
3 Fatigued Conditions, you suffer –30 to all Tests You can also
be subject to multiple, different Conditions at once When this
occurs, the effects do not stack; you suffer the highest of the two
penalties and apply it So, if you had the Exhausted and Prone
Conditions, you would suffer a –20 penalty to all active Tests,
not –30
Complete Condition List
Ablaze, Bleeding, Blinded, Broken, Deafened, Entangled,
Fatigued, Poison, Prone, Stunned, Surprised, Unconscious
Conditions and Resolve
A Condition can be removed with Resolve points so, while
many are debilitating, if you are careful they can be relatively
easily managed (see page 171)
Master Condition List
The following are the conditions used in WFRP
Ablaze
You are on fire! This Condition is normally only applied if you are
flammable — for example: wearing clothes that can be set alight
— but some magical and divine effects can set you alight even if
you are not normally combustible!
RULES V
167
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
At the end of every Round, you suffer 1d10 Wounds, modified
by Toughness Bonus and Armour Points, with a minimum of 1
Wound suffered Each extra Ablaze Condition you have adds +1
to the Damage suffered; so, three Ablaze Conditions result in
1d10+2 Damage suffered
One Ablaze Condition can be removed with a successful Athletics
Test, with each SL removing an extra Ablaze Condition The
Difficulty for this Test is modified by circumstances: it’s much
easier to put out a fire rolling around on sand than it is in the
middle of an oil-soaked kitchen
Bleeding
You are bleeding badly Lose 1 Wound at the end of every Round,
ignoring all modifiers Further, suffer a penalty of –10 to any Tests
to resist Festering Wounds, Minor Infection, or Blood Rot (see
page 186) If you reach 0 Wounds, you no longer lose Wounds
and instead fall immediately unconscious (gain the Unconscious
Condition) At the end of Round, you have a 10% chance of
dying per Bleeding Condition you have; so, if you had 3 Bleeding
Conditions, you would die from blood loss on a roll of 0–30 You
cannot regain consciousness until all Bleeding Conditions are
removed (see Injury on page 172)
A Bleeding Condition can be removed with: a successful Heal
Test, with each SL removing an extra Bleeding Condition; or
with any spell or prayer that heals Wounds, with one Condition
removed per Wound healed
Once all Bleeding Conditions are removed, gain one Fatigued
Condition
Blinded
Perhaps because of a flash of light, or because of liquid sprayed in
your face, you are unable to see properly You suffer a –10 penalty
to all Tests involving sight, and any opponent attacking you in
close combat gains a bonus of +10 to hit you
One Blinded Condition is removed at the end of every other
Round
Broken
You are terrified, defeated, panicked, or otherwise convinced you
are going to die On your turn, your Move and Action must be
used to run away as fast as possible until you are in a good hiding
place beyond the sight of any enemy; then you can use your
Action on a Skill that allows you to hide more effectively You
also receive a penalty of –10 to all Tests not involving running
and hiding
You cannot Test to rally from being Broken if you are Engaged
with an enemy (see page 159) If you are unengaged, at the end
of each Round, you may attempt a Cool Test to remove a Broken
Condition, with each SL removing an extra Broken Condition,
and the Difficulty determined by the circumstances you currently
find yourself: it is much easier to rally when hiding behind a barrel
down an alleyway far from danger (Average +20) than it is when
three steps from a slavering Daemon screaming for your blood
(Very Hard –30)
If you spend a full Round in hiding out of line-of-sight of any
enemy, you remove 1 Broken Condition
Once all Broken Conditions are removed, gain 1 Fatigued
Condition
Deafened
Whether caused by a loud noise or a blow to the head, you are
unable to hear properly You suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests
involving hearing, and any opponent attacking you in close
combat from the flank or rear gains an extra bonus of +10 to
hit you (this bonus does not increase with multiple Deafened
Conditions) One Deafened condition is removed at the end of
every other Round and is often replaced with tinnitus
Entangled
You are wrapped in something restricting your movement; it
could be ropes, spider’s webbing, or an opponent’s bulging biceps
On your turn, you may not Move, and all your actions involving
movement of any kind suffer a penalty of –10 (including
Grappling; see page 163) For your Action, you can remove an
Entangled Condition if you win an Opposed Strength Test
against the source of the entanglement, with each SL removing
an extra Entangled Condition
Options: Getting Tired…
For GMs keen to have characters tiring as they undertake
strenuous activity, use the following rule: Gain 1 Fatigued
Condition if you fail an Endurance Test after a number of
Rounds of continued exertion equal to your Toughness Bonus
Each SL extends how many rounds pass before you need Test
again
V
168
Fatigued
You are exhausted or stressed, and certainly in need of rest You
suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests Removing a Fatigued Condition
normally requires rest, a spell, or a divine effect, though in
some instances, such as when a Fatigued Condition is caused
by carrying too much (see Encumbrance on page 293), simply
changing your circumstances (carrying fewer trappings, for
example) can remove a Condition
How Much Rest?
How much rest is required to remove a Fatigued condition
is up to the GM and the style of game you are playing
Some groups prefer a relatively realistic approach and remove
a Fatigue condition after a prolonged rest Others require only
an hour or so of rest for each Fatigue condition, preferring
to press on with the adventure rather than worry about tired
characters And some remove a Fatigue condition per round of
rest, keeping things fast and simple It’s up to you and your
group to decide how much rest you need
Poisoned
You have been poisoned or injected with venom All Tests to
remove poison have their difficulty determined by the poison
or venom suffered At the end of each Round, lose 1 Wound,
ignoring all modifiers Also, suffer a penalty of –10 to all Tests
If you reach 0 Wounds when Poisoned, you cannot heal any
Wounds until all Poisoned conditions are removed If you fall
Unconscious when Poisoned, make an Endurance Test after
a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus or die
horribly See Injury on page 172 for more on this
At the end of each Round, you may attempt an Endurance
Test If successful, remove a Poisoned Condition, with each SL
removing an extra Poisoned Condition A Heal Test provides the
same results Once all Poisoned Conditions are removed, gain 1
Fatigued Condition
Prone
You have fallen to the ground, possibly because you have run
out of Wounds, you’ve tripped, or because you’ve been hit by
something rather large On your turn, your Move can only be
used to stand up or crawl at half your Movement in yards (note:
if you have 0 Wounds remaining, you can only crawl) You suffer
a –20 penalty to all Tests involving movement of any kind, and
any opponent trying to strike you in Melee Combat gains +20
to hit you
Unlike most other conditions, Prone does not stack — you are
either Prone, or you are not You lose the Prone Condition when
you stand up
Stunned
You have been struck about the head or otherwise disorientated
or confused; your ears are likely ringing, and little makes sense
You are incapable of taking an Action on your turn but are
capable of half your normal movement You can defend yourself
in opposed Tests — but not with Language (Magick) You
also suffer a –10 penalty to all Tests If you have any Stunned
Conditions, any opponent trying to strike you in Melee Combat
gains +1 Advantage before rolling the attack
At the end of each Round, you may attempt a Challenging (+0)
Endurance Test If successful, remove a Stunned Condition, with
each SL removing an extra Stunned Condition
Once all Stunned Conditions are removed, gain 1 Fatigued
Condition if you don’t already have one
Surprised
You have been caught unawares and you aren’t at all ready for
what’s about to hit you You can take no Action or Move on your
turn and cannot defend yourself in opposed Tests Any opponent
trying to strike you in Melee Combat gains a bonus of +20 to hit
The Surprised Condition does not stack, so you do not collect
multiple Surprised Conditions, even should you be technically
surprised multiple times in a Round
At the end of each Round, or after the first attempt to attack you,
you lose the Surprised Condition
Unconscious
You are knocked out, asleep, or otherwise insensible You can
do nothing on your turn and are completely unaware of your
surroundings Any Melee attack targeting you automatically
hits on the location of the attacker’s choice with the maximum
possible SL it could score, and also inflicts a Critical Wound; or,
if the GM prefers, any close combat hit simply kills you Any
ranged combat hit automatically does the same if the shooter is
at Point Blank range
The Unconscious Condition does not stack — you are either
Unconscious, or you are not — so you do not collect multiple
Unconscious Conditions
Recovering from unconsciousness requires different circumstances
depending upon why you fell unconscious Refer to Injury on
page 172 for more on this If you spend a Resolve point to remove
an Unconscious condition, but have not resolved the cause of the
incapacitation, you gain another Unconscious Condition at the
end of the round When you lose the Unconscious Condition,
you gain the Prone and Fatigued Conditions

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Fate & Resilience
Whether it’s guts, luck or the favour of the gods, there is
something special about you Fate and Resilience represent the
different ways you stand out from the masses
Characters gain their starting Fate and Resilience in Character
Generation (see page 34) Both are related to pools of points:
Fate to Fortune, Resilience to Resolve You may spend your
points to achieve small benefits, and these pools will refill over
the course of play You spend your Fate or Resilience points for
a significant benefit during play but this permanently reduces
them and also reduces the associated pool of Fortune or Resolve
points While Fate and Resilience points may be regained, this
occurs only rarely, so spend them carefully
Although they are very rare and normally reserved for PCs, the
GM may also want to apply Fate and Resilience to noteworthy
NPCs, like a necromantic nemesis, a local luminary of significance,
or a recurring cult leader
Fate and Fortune
Player characters have destiny While their ultimate future is a
mystery and there is no guarantee it will be glorious, heroic, or
even pleasant, they are seemingly fated for something important
To represent this, you begin play with a number of Fate Points
Fate points mark you out from the rest of the denizens of the
Old World They allow you to survive against impossible odds and
prevail where ordinary folk fail
Fate is directly related to your Fortune points Fortune points
are spent to receive minor bonuses, including the ability to reroll
failed Tests or gain an edge as luck favours you, and the number
you have will likely fluctuate wildly during play Fate determines
how many Fortune points you can have, and be permanently
spent in the direst of circumstances to avoid death
Spending Fortune
You may spend a Fortune point from your pool to turn luck to
your advantage: hitting with that difficult crossbow shot when
you would have otherwise missed; or perhaps an opponent slips,
granting you a chance to land a blow Your three options are:
	 Reroll a failed Test
	 Add +1 SL to a Test after it is rolled
	 At the start of the Round, choose when to act in that Round
disregarding Initiative order
Spending Fate
You may spend a permanent Fate point to avoid death and survive
even the most unlikely situations When you do this, choose one
of the following two options:
	 Die Another Day:  Instead of dying, your character is
knocked out, left for dead, swept away by a river, or otherwise
taken out of action; your character will survive, no matter
the fatal incident’s circumstances, but takes no further part
in the current encounter
	 How Did That Miss?:  Your character completely avoids
the incoming damage by some extraordinary fluke, such
as slipping just as a blow is about to connect, a weapon
mysteriously jamming, or an unexpected source of light
blinding an opponent; your character can continue on
without penalty, but has no guarantee of survival in later
rounds
V
The first option takes you out of play, but allows you to fight
another day, for all your character may be battered, bloody,
bruised, and perhaps even captured in the process! The second
option allows you to continue fighting side-by-side with your
companions, but leaves you in significant danger, meaning
you may need to spend more Fate points in later Rounds to
ensure survival Each option has advantages and disadvantages,
depending upon the context of the situation, and it is up to you
to decide which is the best choice to take
The GM describes how you survive a given situation after
spending a Fate rating point
Regaining Fate and Fortune
You regain all Fortune points at the start of every gaming
session, up to the maximum of your current Fate In addition,
certain in-game encounters may also replenish (or remove!)
Fortune points
Your GM may grant you a Fate point for an act of extreme
heroism, bravery, or significance Normally this only happens at
the successful end of an important adventure, so make sure to
spend them carefully as they rarely replenish
Long Gaming Sessions
Some players prefer short sessions of a few hours, others
prefer day-long marathons If your group prefers longer
sessions, replenish Fortune points at narratively appropriate
moments, roughly every four hours
Resilience and Resolve
While Fate points represent your destiny, perhaps chosen by
some distant, uncaring deity, Resilience is an indication of your
personal drive and determination to endure, and overcome, no
matter the obstacles you face
Like Fate, Resilience is directly linked to a pool of points, this time
called Resolve Resolve points are spent to push through minor
obstacles, such as ignoring the negative effects of critical wounds
for a Round or removing Conditions Resilience determines your
upper limit of Resolve points and can be permanently spent to
push yourself through seemingly impossible situations
Spending Resolve
You may spend a Resolve point to draw upon your inner reserves:
maybe confronting a terrifying Ogre without flinching; or
ignoring the effects of even the most powerful of blows Your
choices are:
	 Become immune to Psychology until the end of the next
round See Psychology on page 190
	 Ignore all modifiers from all Critical Wounds until the
beginning of the next round
	 Remove one Condition; if you removed the Prone
Condition, regain 1 Wound as you surge to your feet
Spending Resilience
You may also choose to spend Resilience point to defy the
corruption curling  within, or to succeed where it would seem
certain you should fail Here, you have the following two options:
	 I Deny You!:  You may choose not to develop a rolled
mutation Because you do not mutate, you do not lose any
Corruption points See Corruption on page 182 for more
on this
	 I Will Not Fail!: Rather than roll the result of a Test, you
choose the number instead, allowing you to succeed in even
the direst of situations In an Opposed Test, you always win
by at least 1 SL You can even choose to do this on a Test
already failed
Example: A bandit leader is on the rampage, having built
up 10 Advantage while evading the party’s blows Things are
about to get messy! Salundra decides to attack the bandit, but
loses the Opposed Test by 7 SL, which is going to hurt a lot
So, she spends a permanent Resilience point to invoke ‘I Will
Not Fail’ This means she automatically wins the Opposed
Test by +1 SL She also chooses the result of the roll to be 11,
causing a Critical The bandit leader will take some Wounds
and a Critical Wound More importantly, his rampage comes
to an end as he also loses all 10 Advantage as the fight turns
in the heroes favour
RULES V
171
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Saving permanent Resilience to rebuff the influence of Chaos is
wise, but it does not remove your Corruption points, meaning
mutation is still perilously close By comparison, using permanent
Resilience to succeed in any Test can allow you to land a blow
on an otherwise impossible-to-hit target, create an artefact
that astounds all who see it with a Trade skill, or even perfectly
manifest a spell you would normally find impossible to cast
When you spend a Resilience point, take time to describe the
enormous feat of will your character has undertaken, and how
this manifests in play
Regaining Resilience and Resolve
Resolve is regained whenever you act according to your
Motivation (see Motivation on page 34) During play, whenever
you feel you have done this, you may ask the GM if you can
recover one or more Resolve points
Example: Griselda is a nun with the Motivation ‘Sigmar’ While
her allies gossip in a tavern seeking clues, she elects to visit the local
temple to make a donation and offer prayers to her deity As this fits
her Motivation, her GM decides to replenish one of her Resolve
points but tells Griselda’s player that she will need to pray and donate
in a different temple to receive that benefit again this week
The GM may grant a Resilience point for an act of extreme
importance to your Motivation, permanently nourishing your
soul, but such an event will be very rare
Example: After many adventures, Griselda finally finances a
new temple to Sigmar in her home village of Velten not far from
Nuln The GM recognises the importance of this to Griselda’s
faith and grants her a permanent Resilience point
Injury
Almost all characters will suffer injuries during the course of play
The injury rules show you how to deal with them and how to heal
them, when possible
Wounds, Critical Wounds, and Death
Wound loss represents minor cuts and abrasions, bruises and
bashes, and even the depletion of spiritual and mental energy
reserves By comparison, Critical Wounds are much more severe,
expressing serious injuries, broken bones, torn muscles, and
ripped flesh Gain too many Critical Wounds, and you risk death
Wounds
Wounds are lost by sustaining Damage Each time you suffer a
point of Damage, you lose 1 Wound So, if you suffer 8 points of
Damage, you lose 8 Wounds Often, especially in combat, your
Toughness Bonus or Armour Points may reduce suffered Damage
So, if you were hit in the arm for 10 Damage and your Toughness
Bonus was 3, and you had leather armour on that arm for 1
Armour Point, you would suffer 6 Wounds (10–3–1=6) The
rules will tell you when you can or cannot reduce Damage with
Toughness and Armour Points
If you lose all of your Wounds, your collected injuries overwhelm
you, and you gain the Prone Condition Until you heal at least
1 Wound, you cannot lose the Prone Condition; worse, if you’re
not healed within a number of Rounds equal to your Toughness
Bonus, you will pass out, gaining the Unconscious Condition
You will not regain consciousness until you heal back at least 1
Wound (see Healing on page 181)
If you take enough Damage that you would be taken to negative
Wounds — say you suffered 5 Damage when you only had 2
Wounds left — you suffer a Critical Wound If you suffer fewer
negative Wounds than your Toughness Bonus (so, fewer than –4
Wounds if your Toughness Bonus is 4), you subtract –20 from
your Critical Table result, with a minimum result of 01 (see page
174) Note: You never actually go into negative Wounds The
lowest number of Wounds you can ever have is 0
Critical Wounds
Critical Wounds are most commonly suffered in combat when
something really wants to hurt you The two most frequent
sources of Critical Wounds are when a Critical Hit is scored, or
when you lose more Wounds than you have (see Combat on page
159 for more on how Critical Hits happens)
Each Critical Wound you receive will impact your ability to
function in a different way To determine what effects a Critical
Wound has, refer to the Critical Tables (see page 174)
V
172
Pulling Your Blows
The rules assume you wish to inflict every possible Critical
Wound you can However, it’s also possible you may just
want to subdue, not kill, your opponents Or you may be
sparring With that in mind, you may ignore any Critical Hit
you should inflict upon your opponents if you declare you are
‘pulling your blow’ before you roll to hit If you do this, make
sure you describe the situation appropriately, making it clear
you’re using the flat of your blade or otherwise doing what you
can to avoid properly hurting your opponent
Death
If you take the Unconscious Condition and have 0 Wounds,
compare the total number of Critical Wounds you currently
suffer with your Toughness Bonus If you have more Critical
Wounds than your Toughness Bonus, you succumb to your
horrific wounds and will die at the end of the round unless, by
some miracle, someone heals one of your Critical Wounds
Also, if you have the Unconscious Condition, anyone attacking
you with suitable weapons can kill you, should they wish
Though, in the thick of combat, those lying apparently dead on
the floor are almost always ignored in favour of combatants still
standing
Lastly, a few results sourced from the Critical Tables can result in
death Should any of these occur, it is time to permanently spend
a Fate point if you have one (see page 170)
Options: Sudden Death
Rather than worrying about Critical Wounds and protracted
deaths, you may simply wish to know if someone is dead or
not The GM can do this by using the Sudden Death rules,
which significantly accelerates play When your targets suffer
more damage than they have Wounds, they simply die in a
suitably dramatic fashion or immediately gain the Unconscious
Condition Your choice
Sudden Death is especially useful for quickly dealing with
minor foes such as Brigands, Cultists, or Wild Animals,
although it should not be used for PCs or important NPCs

Critical Tables
When you receive a Critical Wound, you do not determine the struck location by reversing your roll Instead, you roll 1d100 again and
refer to Determine Hit Location (see page 159), then roll another 1d100 and refer to the appropriate Critical Table to determine what has
happened You suffer the number of Wounds indicated, not modified by Toughness Bonus or Armour Points, though these will never trigger
a second Critical Wound Further, you suffer any Additional Effects noted If your Character suffers from the Unconscious Condition, you
remain unconscious until the end of the encounter, or until you receive Medical Attention (see Healing on page 181), unless otherwise stated
If a result says you have broken bones, torn muscles, or an amputated body part, refer to Broken Bones on page 179, Torn Muscles on page
179, or Amputated Parts on page 180, for what happens

Muscle (Major) and Broken Bone (Minor) injury
81–85 Broken Knee 4 The blow hacks into your kneecap, shattering it into several pieces You gain
1 Bleeding, 1 Prone, and 1 Stunned Condition, and a Broken Bone (Major)
Injury as you fall to the ground, clutching your ruined leg
86–90 Dislocated
Knee
4 Your knee is wrenched out of its socket Gain the Prone Condition Pass a Hard
(–20) Endurance Test, or gain the Stunned Condition, which is not removed
until you receive Medical Attention After this initial Medical Attention, an
Extended Average (+20) Heal Test needing 6 SL is required to reset the knee at
which point you regain its use Movement is halved, and Tests made using this
leg suffer a –10 penalty for d10 days
91–93 Crushed Foot 5 The blow crushes your foot Make an Average (+20) Endurance Test; if you fail,
gain the Prone condition and lose 1 toe, plus 1 additional toe for each SL below
0 — Amputation (Average) Gain 2 Bleeding Conditions If you don't receive
Surgery within 1d10 days, you will lose the foot entirely
94–96 Severed Foot 5 Your foot is severed at the ankle and lands 1d10 feet away in a random direction
— Amputation (Hard) (see Scatter) You gain 3 Bleeding, 2 Stunned, and 1
Prone Condition
97–99 Cut Tendon 5 A major tendon at the back of your leg is cut, causing you to scream out in pain
as your leg collapses Gain 2 Bleeding, 2 Stunned, and 1 Prone Condition and
look on in horror as your leg never works again — Amputation (Very Hard)
00 Shattered
Pelvis
Death The blow shatters your pelvis, severing one leg then driving through to the next
You die instantly from traumatic shock
Healing Hands
Critical Wounds are frequently nasty, so if you want to survive
your journeys through the Old World, it is recommended you
wear armour and bring at least one companion with some
form of healing skills or spells, and perhaps even one skilled
in surgery If you do not, you may succumb to your wounds
or infection long before you reach the next settlement
Broken Bones
Small fractures may heal on their own accord, but severe breaks,
with bone protruding at odd angles from the flesh, are a different
matter entirely If you suffer a Broken Bone, it will be marked as
minor or major
Minor
You have fractured one of your bones, but it is still aligned,
meaning it may heal of its own accord without medical attention
The Hit Location is unusable until the breakage heals For Arm
and Leg hits, you are down to one limb as the other is too painful
to use, and may require binding Use the rules for a Severed Arm
or Leg to represent this (see Amputated Parts)
For Head hits you will be down to a liquid diet and will suffer a
penalty of –30 to all Language Tests For Body hits, your strength
and mobility will be severely limited: suffer a loss of –30 to your
Strength and Agility Characteristics, and half your Move
Healing: A fractured bone will take 30+1d10 days to heal At the
end of this, a successful Average (+20) Endurance Test means
the bone has set well, and no long-term effects will be suffered If
the Test is failed, you suffer a permanent loss of –5 to all Agility
Tests when using a damaged arm, a permanent loss of –5 to your
Agility characteristic for a badly healed Body or Leg hit, or a
permanent loss of –5 to spoken Language Tests for a badly healed
Head hit
A successful Average (+20) Heal Test within a week of receiving
the fracture will negate the need for the Endurance Test, but
the affected area must remain bound and held in place for the
duration of the healing If the binding should be undone, another
Average (+20) Heal Test enacted within a day will need to be
passed to avoid the Endurance Test
Major
One of your bones is badly broken, and is either resting at an odd
angle, or has splintered at the point of breakage It is unlikely to
heal properly without medical attention
The Hit Location is effectively unusable until the breakage
heals Use all the same rules as for Broken Bone (Minor)
Healing: Healing takes 10 days longer All associated Tests are
Challenging (+0) Any penalties for failed Tests increase to –10
Torn Muscles
Sprains or tears to your muscles or ligaments result in significant
pain and possible loss of use depending upon the severity, which
will be marked as minor or major
Minor
One of your muscles is sprained or torn, resulting in impaired
capabilities and much pain Suffer a penalty of –10 to all Tests
involving the location If a Leg is hit, also halve your Movement
RULES V
179
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Healing: The muscle will partially heal in 30 – your Toughness
Bonus days Use of the Healing skill will reduce the time by 1 day,
plus a further day per SL (you can gain this benefit once)
Major
One of your muscles or some important tendons have been
severely damaged, resulting in extreme pain and a significant loss
in capability of the afflicted limb
Suffer the same effects as Torn Muscle (Minor), but the penalties
are –20 to all Tests
Healing: The muscle will partially heal in 30 – your Toughness
Bonus days, after which the penalty for using the limb reduces
to –10 to all relevant Tests The muscle will completely heal
after another 30 – your Toughness Bonus days Use of the
Healing skill does little but inform you not to use the affected
Hit Location
Amputated Parts
Many of the more severe Critical Wounds result in the loss of a
body part, such as fingers, hands, feet, or even a whole leg! Should
a character suffer more than one severed body part, it is probably
time to start looking for an appropriate replacement to mitigate
any possible penalties (see Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide)
Whenever you suffer a Critical Wound marked Amputation
(difficulty), you must pass an Endurance Test (the difficulty is
marked in the brackets) or gain a Prone Condition On a Failure
(–2) or worse, you also gain a Stunned Condition; on an Impressive
Failure (–4 or worse), gain an Unconscious Condition
All amputations require Surgery to heal properly, meaning 1
Wound cannot be healed until you visit a surgeon See Surgery
on page 181
Arm
Use the rules for lost hand, but you cannot strap a shield to the
arm since you don’t have one
Ear
Losing an ear is painful, but you will soon learn to live without it
Should you have the bad luck to lose both your ears, permanently
suffer a penalty of –20 to all hearing-based Perception Tests
Further, you suffer a penalty of –5 to all Fellowship Tests per ear
lost when others can see your earless state
Eye
For all losing an eye is horrendous, but you soon learn to
compensate Should you have the misfortune to lose both eyes,
suffer a penalty of –30 to all Tests influenced by sight, such as
Weapon Tests, Dodge Tests, Ride Tests, and similar Further, you
suffer a penalty of –5 to all Fellowship Tests per scarred socket
others can see
Fingers
Losing a finger results in lessened grip, causing an increased
chance of fumbling Tests using that hand For the first finger lost,
any relevant, failed Test with a 1 on the units die counts as a
fumble For two lost fingers, any relevant, failed Test with a 1 or 2
on the units die counts as a fumble, and so on
Further, you suffer a penalty of –5 to all Tests using the hand
in question per finger lost Once 4 or more fingers are lost on a
hand, use the rules for a severed hand
Foot
Reduce your Move by half permanently and suffer a –20 penalty
to all Tests that rely on mobility, such as Dodge Losing both
feet makes it hard to walk Perhaps you could hire a henchman
to carry you?
Hand
You take a –20 penalty on all Tests that rely on the use of two
hands and you cannot wield two-handed weapons; however, a
shield can be strapped to the injured arm Should the lost hand be
your primary hand, you take the customary –20 penalty to Melee
Tests made with weapons using your secondary hand For every
100 XP you spend, you can reduce this penalty by 5 as you relearn
how to do everything with the other hand If you lose both hands,
it is probably time to master hook fighting
Leg
Treat this as a lost foot, but you cannot use the Dodge skill at all
Nose
A loss of a nose leaves one looking freakish in the extreme Suffer
a permanent loss of –20 to your Fellowship and suffer a penalty
of –30 to all Tests involving the sense of smell
Teeth
Loss of teeth may be unsightly and can make eating difficult For
every two teeth you lose you also suffer a permanent loss of 1
from your Fellowship characteristic
Further, once more than half your teeth (Humans: 16; Elves: 18;
Halflings and Dwarfs: 20) are lost, you find consuming solids
significantly more difficult than your peers, doubling eating
times, and making some foodstuffs nigh-on impossible to eat,
which is largely a matter of roleplaying and narrative description
of your actions
Toes
Loss of toes has an adverse effect on your balance For each toe
lost, suffer a permanent loss of –1 to your Agility and Weapon
Skill Characteristics
Tongue
A loss of a tongue leaves you grunting and humming, or relying on
make-shift sign language, for communication You automatically
fail all Language Tests involving speaking
V

Healing
In time, most injuries heal But some are worse than others The
following explains how to heal Wounds and Critical Wounds
Healing Wounds
You are considered wounded if you have lost any of your Wounds
Without medical attention, you can attempt an Average
(+20) Endurance Test after a good sleep once a day You Heal
Wounds equal to the SL + your Toughness Bonus For each
day you spend taking it easy, you also heal an extra number of
Wounds equal to your Toughness Bonus
If you wish to Heal more Wounds than this, then you need to
be attended by someone with the Heal skill (see Chapter 4:
Skills and Talents) or you’ll need bandages, a healing poultice,
or similar (see Chapter 11: Consumers’ Guide)
There is no penalty for being wounded Lost Wounds are
considered to be small cuts, bruises, and other easily ignored
injuries
Healing Critical Wounds
If you have received any Critical Wounds, you are said to be
Critically Wounded Critical Wounds can be very serious Refer
to the appropriate Critical Table to see exactly what penalties you
suffer for any Critical Wounds sustained Critical Wounds do not
count as healed until all conditions they inflict are removed, and
all non-permanent negative modifiers are resolved When you are
Critically Wounded, you may still heal your Wounds using the
normal rules
Medical Attention
Several Critical Wound results and conditions cannot be resolved
until you receive medical attention This includes, but is not
limited to, the following:
	 Successful use of the Heal skill
	 Application of a bandage, healing poultice, or similar
	 Successful use of a spell or prayer that heals Wounds
Surgery
Some wounds are beyond simple stitching and foul-smelling
poultices If you suffer a Critical Wound where surgery is
required to attend to it (it will be marked: Surgery), you suffer
the marked penalties until you visit an appropriately trained
doctor or barber-surgeon, or somehow source a magical or divine
surgery equivalent
Further, if you suffer an amputated body part, you cannot heal
1 of the suffered Wounds until a surgeon successfully treats it
with a Heal Test For more information on surgery, refer to the
Surgery talent in Chapter 4: Skills and Talents
Other Damage
The Old World is a dangerous place, hiding countless ways to die
The following covers some of the more common other ways you
can receive Damage during play
Drowning and Suffocation
If prepared, you can hold your breath for Toughness Bonus x 10
seconds without a Test After that, you may start to suffocate or
drown If you are unprepared and suddenly deprived of air, you
will start to suffocate immediately
Each Round you are being suffocated you lose 1 Wound Should
you reach 0 Wounds, you immediately receive the Unconscious
Condition After that, you will die of suffocation or drowning in
Toughness Bonus Rounds
Exposure
Every 4 hours spent in a difficult environment — such as subzero
temperatures, a hot desert, or a howling storm — requires
you take an Endurance Test Extreme environments require a
Test every 2 hours
Cold: Your first failure causes a penalty of –10 Ballistic Skill,
Agility and Dexterity The second failure reduces all other
Characteristics by –10 Third and subsequent failures cause 1d10
Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1
Wound lost If you reach zero Wounds, you immediately take
an Unconscious condition Certain Trappings provide bonuses
to these Tests See page 302
Heat: Your first failure causes a penalty of –10 to Intelligence
and Willpower, and adds a Fatigued Condition The second
failure reduces all other Characteristics by –10%, and adds another
Fatigued Condition Third and subsequent failures cause 1d10
Damage not modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1
Wound lost Stripping off heavy Trappings cancels 1 failed test
Thirst and Starvation
Running out of provisions can be bad Running out of water is
worse Endurance Tests to withstand thirst and hunger become
increasingly difficult (cumulative –10 for every test) Characters
without food and water cannot heal Wounds or recover Fatigue
naturally
Water: Every day without water requires you make an Endurance
test The first failed Test causes a penalty of –10 Intelligence,
Willpower, and Fellowship Second and subsequent failures
reduce all Characteristics by –10 and cause 1d10 Damage not
modified by Armour Points, with a minimum of 1 Wound lost
Food: Every 2 days without food require an Endurance Test The
first failed Tests causes a penalty of –10 Strength and Toughness
Second and subsequent failures reduce all other Characteristics
by –10 and cause 1d10 Damage not modified by Armour Points,
with a minimum of 1 Wound lost

Corruption
Every Festag, Sigmarite priests preach from high pulpits about
the dangers of the Ruinous Powers, about how good folk must
avoid the temptations of daemons whispering from every shadow
They declare all souls are in perpetual peril, mere footsteps from
falling to corruption and mutation And they might be right
Corruption points are used to show the slow, gradual slip of your
soul to the Dark Gods of Chaos Whenever you are exposed to a
potential source of corruption, you may accrue Corruption points
The more you have, the closer you are drawing to Chaos, and the
darker your soul becomes until, eventually, you change…
Gaining Corruption Points
During play, there are two primary routes to gaining corruption:
dark deals and corrupting influences
Dark Deals
Sometimes, you just have to succeed Most commonly this means
passing an important Test Should such a Test fail, you can use
a Fortune point to reroll the Test, hopefully passing the second
time But what if it fails again? Or you have no Fortune points
remaining? Then it’s time for a dark deal
You can purposefully choose to take a Corruption point to reroll
a Test, even if it has been rerolled already This is always a choice
for you, not the GM — although there is nothing wrong with
the GM gently reminding you that you could try again After all,
what’s the worst that could happen?
Options:
Encroaching Darkness…
Some inventive players prefer to embellish their dark deals
with disturbing events happening in-game If you like the
sound of this, it’s up to you how such events should manifest,
but tailoring them to the story of the character involved is
always a good idea Perhaps taint subtly influences the local
area causing animals to flee or plants to gently rot?
Perhaps you could roll on the Miscast table from Chapter
8: Magic to create a random event (especially appropriate
for wizards and witches)? Think of the Test tied to the dark
deed, and then consider soul-staining events that could occur
to ensure your success
Corrupting Influences
Corruption points are usually gained by exposure to a place,
person, or object tainted by Chaos, or to a situation especially
beloved to one of the Dark Gods
If you encounter a corrupting influence, attempt a Challenging
(+0) Endurance Test, or Challenging (+0) Cool Test, as
determined by the GM — usually physical influences are resisted
with Endurance, spiritual corruption is resisted with Cool
The stronger the corrupting influence, the more SL you will need
to avoid it The following provides some examples of corrupting
influences with the number of SL needed to completely avoid
Corruption points
Minor Exposure
These corrupting influences, although relatively trivial, still
endanger a weak soul If a Test is failed to resist such a minor
exposure, gain 1 Corruption point
	 Witness a Lesser Daemon
	 Contact with a Mutant, refined Warpstone, or Chaostainted
artefact
	 Giving in to despair, rage, excess, or the need to change
your lot
	 Being near Warpstone
	 Prolonged exposure to Chaos worshippers, Chaos Cult
Temples, Skaven, Mutant Lairs, and similar
Moderate Exposure
Moderate corrupting influences are a danger to every soul and
should be avoided under all circumstances If a Test is failed,
V
182
gain 2 Corruption points On a Marginal Success (0–1), gain 1
Corruption point On a Success (2+), you gain no Corruption
points
	 Witness multiple Daemons
	 Contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane artefact
	 Embracing despair, rage, excess, or the desire to become
someone new
	 Prolonged exposure to refined Warpstone
	 Brief exposure to an environment steeped with Dhar, dark
magic used by Necromancers and Chaos Sorcerers
Major Exposure
If you find yourself confronted with a major corrupting influence,
flee Stay for too long, and you may never be the same again
For each failed Test to resist a major exposure, gain 3 Corruption
points If you pass with a Marginal Success (0–1), gain 2 Corruption
points On a Success (2–3), you gain 1 Corruption point Only if
you score an Impressive Success (4+), do you gain no Corruption
points
	 Witness a Greater Daemon
	 Prolonged contact with a Daemon, Warpstone, or profane
artefact
	 Making a deal with a Daemon
	 Consuming refined Warpstone
	 Prolonged exposure to an environment steeped with dhar
(see Magic for more on this)
Corrupting
No-one is left unscathed by exposure to the Ruinous Powers
Eventually, even the strongest fall, their mind and bodies twisting
into new unrecognisable forms
Should you ever gain more Corruption points than your
Willpower Bonus plus your Toughness Bonus, immediately
attempt a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test If passed, you have
managed to hold off your corruption for now but will have to
Test again next time you gain Corruption Points If you fail, then
either your body or mind is about to mutate
Dissolution of Body and Mind
As corruption ravages your soul, the warping breath of Chaos
whispers within, either fanning your flesh into a fresh, new form,
or fracturing your psyche with exquisite knowledge it can never
unlearn
First, lose Corruption points equal to your Willpower Bonus as
you mutate Next, roll percentile dice and refer to the following
table to determine whether it’s your body or your mind that
blossoms anew
Elf Halfling Human Dwarf
Body – 01–10 01–50 01–05
Mind 01–100 11–100 51–100 06–100
Now roll on either the Physical Corruption Table (page 184) or
the Mental Corruption Table (page 185) to see what happens
Corruption Limits
A soul can only withstand so much corruption before it
collapses upon itself, leaving a mutated, gibbering mess
Should you survive long enough to gain more mutations than
your Toughness Bonus, or more mental corruptions than
your Willpower Bonus, you have fallen to Chaos, your soul
completely lost to the uncaring Chaos Gods At this point, it’s
time to create a new character Your current one is now damned,
becoming an NPC controlled by the GM, meaning you may
well see the wretched creature again…
Losing Corruption Points
Once the claws of the Dark Gods have sunk into your soul,
removing their vile stain is difficult, but not impossible Beyond
the less-than-desirable option of losing Corruption points
by gaining mutations, there are two other methods of losing
Corruption points: dark whispers and absolution
Dark Whispers
Even considering the inscrutable plans of the Dark Gods is
enough to break a pious man’s sanity, so trying to fathom their
intent, and why they reach out to twist one mortal soul or another,
is not just foolish, it’s extraordinarily dangerous But reach out
they do
The GM may ask to spend one of your Corruption points to
use the darkness building in your soul to twist your actions The
choice to do this or not is always in your hands, but if you agree,
you lose 1 Corruption Point Examples of what may be asked
include:
	 Letting an enemy escape
	 ‘Accidentally’ shooting an ally
	 Falling asleep on watch
Of course, if you deny the GM and choose to do none of those
potentially terrible things, you keep your Corruption point, but
the Ruinous Powers still hold a portion of your soul
RULES V
183
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Be Very Careful
Used sparingly, Corruption Points are great fun as Faustian deals are made for rerolls and traded back for memorable roleplaying
moments as minor betrayals spread, but if you’re playing with a group that doesn’t readily understand the Old World, the points can
accrue very quickly, sending characters into a spiral of mutation and madness This should probably be avoided Mutation is effectively
a death sentence if discovered, so it’s important new players are cautioned when their actions may lead to corruption Just like every
child in the Empire is warned of the dangers posed by the Ruinous Powers, players should be warned that Warpstone should not be
touched or even approached, that tainted artefacts are dangerous, and the Cultists of Chaos should be avoided at all costs Of course,
the circumstances of the adventure at hand may force your group into the most horrendous situations with corruption around every
corner, but that’s WFRP
Physical Corruption Table
Use the descriptions below to help create a unique version of your mutation Take time to describe how it manifests, adding as many
gruesome details as you dare In all cases, if your mutation is obvious, you not only suffer significant penalties to Fellowship Tests as
determined by the circumstance, but people will likely flee from your presence, the Watch will be called, Witch Hunters will descend,
and life will swiftly become very difficult

Absolution
As Corruption points build, and you feel the oppressive fist of the
Dark Gods curling around your beleaguered soul, your dread may
lead you to seek absolution But simply asking forgiveness from
a local preacher won’t be enough The stain of the Dark Gods’
touch isn’t so easily scrubbed clean The exact limits of what is
required to remove Corruption is left in the hands of the GM,
but it is rarely, if ever, simple
Printed adventures may include situations where Corruption can
be removed, but if you wish to seek your own route to absolution,
consider the following
	 Cleanse a profane temple to the Dark Gods Though the
very act may expose you to more corruption…
	 Complete a holy pilgrimage and receive a blessing from a
high priest at the end of the long, dangerous journey
	 Destroy an unholy artefact, or otherwise render it safe,
foiling the schemes of the Dark Gods
	 Join a holy order and dedicate your life to one of the Gods
opposed to Chaos
Options: Slow Manif estations
Manifesting a mutation of the body or mind can come quickly,
but normally it’s a slow process, perhaps starting as an itch,
patch of flaky skin, or a new tic, and only later developing into
a new eye, unexpected feathers, or an entirely new mindset If
you would prefer to draw the mutation process out, perhaps to
play upon the horror of the inevitable mutations to come, you
are encouraged to do so This is left in the hands of the GM to
detail according to individual taste and preference
Mental Corruption Table
A corrupted mind may be less obvious than a sprouting tentacle, but it can be just as devastating to your life Use the description
you roll to build a unique mental mutation that fits your character, taking a little time to create a believable new mindset This as an
opening to portray your character in a new, potentially horrific way, so you can also use your mental mutation as an opportunity to
change your Motivation

Disease and Infection
Plague and pestilence — the purview of Nurgle, the Chaos God
of Disease and Despair — are an everyday fact of Old World life
Yearly outbreaks of disease plague all levels of society, although
the common folk usually fare the worst To ward against these
terrible infections, most turn to the welcoming arms of Nurgle’s
sworn enemy, Shallya, the Goddess of Mercy and Healing, but
those actually suffering a disease will often turn to any possible
cure, ensuring wise women, herbalists, and travelling doktors are
never out of business, even when most peddle quackery rather
than true remedies
Disease Format
	 Name: The name of the disease
 A description of the disease
	 Contraction: How the disease is contracted
	 Incubation: How long before the victim demonstrates
any symptoms
	 Duration: How long the symptoms of the disease last if
untreated At the end of the duration, the disease will
come to an end
	 Symptoms: The effects of the disease on the victim
See Symptoms (page 188) for a list of all the
symptoms, and how they affect a character
	 Permanent: Some diseases are so horrendous they carry
permanent consequences This section is only included
if the affliction has such long-term effects
The Litany of Pestilence
The following offers a tiny sample of the infections, poxes, and
plagues festering in dark corners of the Old World and are
presented as inspiration for creating your own diseases
The Black Plague
Historians claim that centuries ago rats swarmed the Empire
and the Black Plague followed, wiping out nine in every ten
souls Unexplained flare-ups of the horrendous disease still
occur today, and when they do, it always brings no-nonsense
white nuns The Cult of Shallya has sworn to do everything in
its power to eradicate the foul disease, so, using ancient laws and
rights granted to them, white-roped cordon sanitaires are erected
wherever they encounter the Plague, ensuring none can leave or
enter the quarantined area until the outbreak is contained, and all
bodies correctly disposed
Contraction: Enact an Average (+20) Endurance Test for each
hour, or part thereof, spent in an area infested with infected fleas,
or when exposed to infected fluids
Incubation: 1d10 minutes
Duration: 3d10 days
Symptoms: Buboes, Blight (Moderate), Fever, Gangrene, Malaise
Blood Rot
Your very blood is diseased, and your heart now pumps sickness
through your body Leeching the rot is the accepted cure, but
some doktors instead cut careful incisions near the neck to free
the contaminated blood, demanding the patient ingest of vast
quantities of healthy blood to replace what is lost Whether the
patient accepts such remedies or not, without treatment, Blood
Rot is deadly, and will likely end in a visit from the Mourners’

Contraction: As a development of another disease or a Critical
Wound
Incubation: Instant
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Blight, Fever (Severe), Malaise
The Bloody Flux
The Bloody Flux is a persistent problem in the Empire, and
widely viewed to be a curse upon the impious by the Gods The
foul disease causes its unfortunate victim to evacuate the bowels
forcibly and frequently The Bloody Flux is endemic in the State
Armies, where it is commonly claimed to kill more soldiers than
any enemy Typical cures include eating blood pudding to replace
lost humours, ‘corking’, and rubbing fats into the afflicted area to
lessen the sting
Contraction: If you fail an Easy (+40) Toughness Test after an
infected source enters the mouth
Incubation: 2d10 days
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Flux (Severe), Lingering (Challenging), Fever,
Malaise, Nausea
Using Diseases
Some groups love diseases as they add a grim and gritty feel
to their WFRP adventures, and provide medical characters
in careers like Apothecary, Hedge Witch, Herbalist, and
Physician — not to mention Priests and Wizards — extra
utility Others find diseases useful in specific circumstances,
perhaps deployed for dramatic effect to stories including
Skaven or Nurgle Chaos Cultists And some WFRP gamers
find diseases to be an easily forgotten nuisance
It’s up to you and your group to find the best way to include
diseases in your game, but be aware some can be very nasty,
and it’s never fun to have a PC stuck in bed recovering as the
rest of the group goes adventuring, so be careful how they’re
deployed

Festering Wound
Infected cuts and abrasions are commonplace, meaning many
superstitions exist explaining how best to treat them Poultices
fashioned from wrapped leaves and dung, the skin of toads, and
dove-feathers are common, as is rubbing the wound in Sigmar’s
Good Soil Most physicians rubbish such talk, and prefer more
scientific curatives, such as mixing the gall of a black ox with
three spoonfuls of the patient’s urine and half a spoon of sea salt,
which is then rubbed into the festering, pus-filled wound The
screams this elicits prove just how effective the remedy is
Contraction: If you fail an Easy (+40) Endurance Test after a
combat with a creature with the Infected trait (see Bestiary) You
can also develop a Festering Wound from a Minor Infection
Incubation: 1d10 days, or instantly if developed from another
symptom
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Fever, Lingering (Challenging), Malaise, Wounded
Galloping Trots
It is said Halfling food won’t give you Galloping Trots, a messy
affliction all too common in the Empire given just how little care
is given to the proper preparation of food, but those suffering
‘Rumster’s Revenge’ from the cheap, Halfling pies on sale across
Altdorf, would disagree, assuming they could escape the privy for
long enough…
Contraction: If you fail an Easy (+40) Toughness Test after an
infected source enters the mouth
Incubation: 1d10 hours
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Flux (Moderate), Malaise, Nausea
Itching Pox
Annual outbreaks of Itching Pox afflict most towns and cities of
the Empire The disease, which causes body-wide itchy blisters,
is relatively mild, and very rarely has lasting complications, so it
concerns few outside worried parents or vain nobles So common
is it, that most temples of Shallya have vials of white paste on
hand to relieve the itching of the afflicted
Contraction: If you fail an Average (+20) Endurance Test when
contact is made with an infected individual or fail the same Test
when an infected individual coughs or sneezes in your immediate
vicinity (at a rate of about one Test per hour of exposure)
Incubation: 1d10 days
Duration: 1d10+7 days
Symptoms: Coughs and Sneezes, Pox
Permanent: Once the disease is contracted, you become
immune to catching it again
Minor Infection
Minor infections — slow-healing wounds with a modicum of
swelling and heat — are extremely common Most heal of their
own accord in time, so few worry about them until it’s too late,
and Morr’s Portal opens
Contraction: If you fail a Very Easy (+60) Endurance Test after
a combat where you suffered a Critical Wound
Incubation: 1d10 days
Duration: 1d10 days
Symptoms: Lingering (Easy), Malaise, Wounded
Packer’s Pox
A common infection amongst hunters, furriers, and traders,
Packer’s Pox is contracted from infected cattle and sheep,
including their hides and wool, and from the bodies of those
killed by the disease It starts as a small itchy rash, but soon pink,
depressed blisters spread across the whole body, concentrating on
the torso and arms Not the worst of the various poxes plaguing
the Empire, but it does linger for a very long time, and can
occasionally turn deadly
Contraction: If you fail an Easy (+40) Endurance Test after any
contact with infected animals, hides, or bodies
Incubation: 1d10 days
Duration: 5d10 days
Symptoms: Lingering (Challenging), Pox
Ratte Fever
Contracted from infected rodents, dreaded Ratte Fever brings
inflamed rashes and ulcerations before a fever rises and the body
begins to spasm Though rarely fatal, it’s a debilitating disease,
and it takes a long time to recover, so most are willing to try
anything to lessen the symptoms Common remedies include
self-flagellation in Altdorf — which reputedly does bring some
relief to the skin infections — and smearing oneself in goatcheese
mixed with imported Kislevite ice-peppers in Talabheim
In the bigger towns and cities, Ratte Fever is also known as Pie
Fever given just how many savoury pasties contain tainted rat in
place of more expensive meat
RULES V

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Contraction: If you fail an Average (+20) Endurance Test after
any combat when wounded by rodents (including Skaven) with
the Infected Trait, or you fail an Easy (+40) Endurance Test
after an infected source enters your mouth
Incubation: 3d10+5 days
Duration: 3d10+10 days
Symptoms: Convulsions, Fever, Lingering (Average), Malaise,
Pox, Wounded
Symptoms
This section explains how the symptoms for each infection
manifests Use them to create your own disgusting diseases
Stirring Nurgle’s Cauldron
Nurgle, the Chaos God of Pestilence and Decay, keeps a
bubbling cauldron in the foulest corner of its rotting garden,
within which is brewed every plague that ever was, or ever
will be And there is no reason you can’t do the same! The
twelve symptoms provided here are a perfect start for creating
your own foul diseases All you need do is think of a nasty
infection, figure out how it’s contracted, decide how long it
lasts, then assign a few symptoms
Say you wanted to create a disease called Weevil Cough
You first decide how it’s contracted (from exposure to those
already infected, or to mites in hay, wheat, and flour, requiring
an Average (+20) Endurance Test to avoid), then how long its
Incubation and Duration is (say, 1d10 days for each), then
assign Symptoms (Coughs and Sneezes, and Malaise) Done!
Blight
You are seriously ill and perhaps close to Morr’s Portal as deadly
poisons flood your body
Pass a Very Easy (+60) Endurance daily (normally when you
sleep) or die, passing away, perhaps in your sleep, perhaps lost in
a fever, perhaps in agony If Blight is marked as (Moderate), this
Test is Easy (+40); if marked as (Severe), this Test is Average
(+20)
Treatment: None that work
Buboes
You have huge swellings of the lymph nodes, possibly in the
groin, neck or armpits These are enormously painful and may
bleed or seep pus They are disgusting, smelly, and some would
argue a sure sign of the Lord of Pestilence’s favour, believing they
hide tiny, growing Daemons Common practice is to lance these
terrible expressions of taint to remove whatever nestles within,
though doing so often results in Festering Wounds
Suffer a penalty of –10 to all physical Tests, and to all Fellowship
Tests if the buboes can be seen (or smelled!)
Treatment: A successful Heal Test with Surgery can lance
your buboes, removing the penalty If the Test is failed, gain a
Festering Wound If your Buboes are lanced, make a Difficult
(–10) Endurance Test once per day or more swell into place
Convulsions
Your body periodically spasms or shakes as the infection
seemingly uses you like a puppet
Suffer a penalty of –10 to all physical Tests as your body convulses
beyond your control If this symptom is marked as (Moderate),
the penalty increases to –20 If it is marked as (Severe), you
need to be tied down in order not to hurt yourself, leaving you
effectively incapacitated
Treatment: Rare herbs and alchemical mixes can lessen this
symptom for a day, bringing Severe down to Moderate, and
Moderate down to standard convulsions These can be created by
any with the Trade (Apothecary) skill and access to the appropriate
ingredients (which can cost upwards of 10 shillings or more per
dose) The final medicine is Rare and usually genuine (80%), and
can be bought for around 1 GC per dose from Apothecaries,
putting it beyond the reach of most citizens of the Empire
Coughs and Sneezes
You intermittently cough or sneeze, spreading your disease to all
around you Any characters in your environment are exposed to
the disease you carry, and need Test for Contraction once per
hour, or part thereof, of exposure
Treatment: None that work
Fever
Your temperature is high, you’re likely sweating, and you really
don’t look at all well Suffer a penalty of –10 to all physical and
Fellowship Tests If your Fever is marked as (Severe), it has
completely incapacitated you, leaving you bed-ridden Take the
Unconscious Condition, though expenditure of a Resolve point
can bring consciousness for a few minutes
Treatment: There are many common, often disgusting, remedies
for a fever, most of which don’t work (only 10% of commercial
cures are genuine) A successful Heal Test does little more that
inform you how long the fever will likely last The cures range
from a few pennies to many shillings in cost If genuine, they will
remove the symptoms of a Fever (not a severe one) if you pass a
Challenging (+0) Endurance Test

Flux
There’s a rumble and a grumble, then you’re off for yet another
sprint to the splattered outhouse Pale and weary, you’ve had
better days Any given situation may be the moment you just have
to go to the privy You are expected to take every opportunity
you can to pop off for an essential stop, and this is largely left in
your hands In addition, the GM can choose any point during
the session’s play to claim you need to go You have a number of
rounds equal to your Toughness Bonus to get to an appropriate
place to relieve yourself; whether you get there in time or not,
your body will empty itself in a spectacular fashion If the Flux is
marked as (Moderate), the GM can make you go twice a session
If it is marked as (Severe), the GM can do it three times, and
you will also lose 1 Wound per visit, as the bloody flux leaves you
utterly drained
Treatment: Real cures for the Flux are rare (10% of commercial
remedies are genuine), but many apothecaries and herbalists
swear theirs work every time Costs vary widely according to
where you buy the cures, from a few brass coins to small bag of
silver If genuine, the Flux can be held off for your Toughness
Bonus in hours by taking a remedy
Gangrene
Your flesh is turning black, dying, infected with something awful,
and it isn’t going to get better Roll percentile dice to determine a
Hit Location (see Combat) If you roll Body, luckily the Gangrene
did not settle in during this infection If you roll Head, your nose
is affected If you roll Arms, it’s your fingers If you roll Leg, it’s
your feet Each day, roll an Average (+20) Endurance Test If
you pass, you hold off the Gangrene; if you fail, it grows worse
If you ever fail more times than you have Toughness Bonus, you
completely lose all capability with the affected location If this
occurs, use the same rules as Amputation (see Critical Wounds)
For as long as you have Gangrene, suffer a penalty –10 to all
Fellowship Tests, and suffer the Wounded symptom Further,
if not already suffering it, you also suffer from Blight until the
affected tissue is amputated; this remains even if you are cured of
the disease that started the Gangrene
Treatment: Amputation of the gangrenous location is the only
effective treatment
Lingering
You have an infection that just refuses to go away Indeed,
you fear it may be getting worse… After your disease reaches
the end of its duration, attempt an Endurance Test with the
Difficulty marked on the symptom like so: Lingering (Average)
or Lingering (Easy) If this scores a Marginal Failure (0), the
duration extends for an extra 1d10 days If it scores a Failure (–2),
develop a Festering Wound On an Astounding Failure (–6), you
instead develop Blood Rot
Treatment: Cures for lingering infections are commonplace
and usually relatively cheap, rarely costing more than a shilling
However, almost all are fake or based on faulty lore Any bought
cure has only a 10% chance of being genuine, but if so will negate
the need to roll the Endurance Test if taken on the correct day
(which will require a successful Heal Test to determine)
Malaise
You don’t feel at all well You are tired, find it hard to concentrate,
and just generally ill Take a Fatigued Condition that you can
only remove when you have recovered from your illness
Treatment: Medicine treating Malaise, costing anything from a
few pence to a handful of silver, is usually genuine (75% chance);
and, if so, pass a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test to ignore the
symptom for the day
Nausea
You feel very sick and are prone to vomiting if you move
around too quickly Whenever you fail a Test involving physical
movement, your nausea overwhelms you and you vomit You gain
the Stunned condition, which represents you being sick repeatedly
or dry heaving, depending upon your current circumstances
Treatment: Remedies for Nausea are Common and usually
genuine (60% chance), and typically cost around thirty pennies;
if genuine, pass a Challenging (+0) Endurance Test, and the
Nausea can be ignored for a number of hours equal to your
Toughness Bonus
Pox
You are covered in pustules, inflamed swellings, disgusting
rashes, or itchy spots, which are unlikely to be your most
attractive feature Pox are largely a cosmetic issue, resulting in a
penalty of –10 to Fellowship Tests Additionally, remember to
roleplay and describe all the scratching; if you want to withhold
from this for a while, pass an Average (+20) Cool Test When
the Pox ends, attempt an Average (+20) Cool Test If this fails,
reverse the Test dice and apply permanent scarring to that Hit
Location, showing an area where you scratched and the pox
there healed badly If the Hit Location is the head, permanently
lose 1 in Fellowship See Combat for more on Hit Locations
Treatment: Poxes are exceedingly common, and so are remedies,
which are usually creams or oils Larger temples of Shallya
often keep a stock of the cream for free (though donations are
expected) and apothecaries and herbalists of all kinds sell similar
products for relatively low prices (rarely more than six or seven
pence for a week’s worth of treatment, with a 90% chance of
being genuine medicine) Using a cream increases all Cool Tests
to resist scratching to Very Easy (+60), but is usually unsightly
Wounded
You have a wound or open sore that does not heal properly
because of an infection For each Wounded symptom you have,
you cannot heal one of your Wounds, which stays open and sore,
possibly seeping foul-smelling pus Every day, take an Easy (+20)
Endurance Test or gain a Festering Wound if you do not already
have one
RULES V
189
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Treatment: A daily successful Heal Test ensures the Wound
is clean and does not require an Endurance Test to be further
infected
Psychology
Our emotions and instincts have a powerful impact on how we
react in certain circumstances These rules bring another level of
drama to your game and help bring the Old World’s inhabitants
to life
Psychology Test
If you are exposed to one of the following Psychological traits, you
may resist its effects by passing a Cool Test at the beginning of
the Round, with the Difficulty set by the GM A successful Test
lasts until the end of the current encounter, although additional
Tests may be required if circumstances change
Example: Brokk has Animosity (Elves) When the Dwarf
encounters some haughty Elves quaffing wine and laughing
loudly in a tavern, he Tests his Cool to control himself; he passes,
so is not subject to Animosity, though he does choose to spit on
the ground as he passes the sneering things Later, when one of
the Elves jostles his arm, spilling his ale, his GM asks Brokk to
Test again This time he fails So, setting down his tankard, he
turns around to ‘have a word’ with the offending Elf, unable to
stop himself from launching into a tirade about exactly what he
thinks of their so-called nimbleness!
Psychological Traits
The following are the most common Psychology traits in WFRP
Animosity (Target)
You harbour an enmity for the Target, which will normally be a
group of people or creatures, such as ‘Nordlanders’, ‘Beastmen’,
or ‘Nobles’ You must attempt a Psychology Test whenever you
encounter the group If you pass, you may grumble and spit, but
only suffer a penalty of –20 to all Fellowship Tests towards that
group Should you fail you are subject to Animosity
At the end of every subsequent Round, you may attempt another
Psychology test to bring the Animosity to an end If you do
not, the effects of Animosity naturally come to an end when all
members of the specified group in your line of sight are utterly
pacified or gone, or you gain the Stunned or Unconscious
Condition, or you become subject to another Psychology
When subject to Animosity, you must immediately attack the
disagreeable creatures, either socially (insults, jibes, and similar)
or physically (most commonly with fists), as appropriate You also
gain a bonus of +1 SL on any attempts to socially or mentally
attack the group Animosity is over-ridden by Fear and Terror
Fear (Rating)
The Fear trait represents an extreme aversion to something
Creatures that cause Fear have a Fear Rating; this value reflects
the SL you are required to pass on an Extended Cool Test to
overcome your Fear You may continue to Test at the end of
every round until your SL equals or surpasses the creature’s Fear
rating Until you do this, you are subject to Fear
When subject to Fear, you suffer –1 SL on all Tests to affect
the source of your fear You may not move closer to whatever is
causing Fear without passing a Challenging (+0) Cool Test If it
comes closer to you, you must pass a Challenging (+0) Cool Test,
or gain a Broken Condition
Frenzy
With a Willpower Test, you can work yourself into a state of
frenzy by psyching yourself up, howling, biting your shield, or
similar If you succeed, you become subject to Frenzy
While subject to Frenzy you are immune to all other psychology,
and will not flee or retreat for any reason; indeed you must
always move at full rate towards the closest enemy you can see
in order to attack Generally, the only Action you may take is
a Weapon Skill Test or an Athletics Test to reach an enemy
more quickly Further, you may take a Free Action Melee Test
each Round as you are throwing everything you have into your
attacks Lastly, you gain a bonus of +1 Strength Bonus, such is
your ferocity You remain in Frenzy until all enemies in your line
of sight are pacified, or you receive the Stunned or Unconscious
condition After your Frenzy is over you immediately receive a
Fatigued condition
Hatred (Target)
You are consumed with Hatred for the Target, which is
normally a group of people or creatures, such as ‘Hochlanders’,
‘Bog Octopuses’, or ‘Slavers’ You will never socially interact
with someone or something you hate in this manner On
encountering the object of your Hatred, you must attempt a
Psychology Test If failed, you are subject to Hatred At the
end of every subsequent Round, you may attempt another
Psychology Test to bring the Hatred to an end If you do or
not, the effects of Hatred naturally come to an end when all
members of the specified group in your line of sight are dead
or gone, or you gain the Unconscious condition While subject
to Hatred, you must immediately attempt to destroy the hated
group by the fastest and most deadly means possible You gain a
bonus of +1 SL on all combat Tests against the specified group,
and are immune to Fear and Intimidate (but not Terror) caused
by your hated foe
Prejudice (Target)
You really dislike the Target, which is normally a group of people
or creatures such as ‘Ostlanders’, ‘Elves’, or ‘Wizards’ You must
attempt a Psychology Test whenever you encounter the group
against which you are prejudiced If you pass, you may frown a lot,
but will otherwise act normally, only suffering a penalty of –10 to
V
190
all Fellowship Tests towards that group Should you fail you are
subject to Prejudice At the end of every subsequent Round, you
may attempt another Psychology test to bring the Prejudice to an
end If you do not, the effects of Prejudice naturally come to an
end when all members of the specified group in your line of sight
are gone, or you gain the Stunned or Unconscious Condition, or
you become subject to another Psychology
When subject to Prejudice, you must immediately insult the
target of your prejudice Loudly
Terror (Rating)
Some creatures are so profoundly unsettling as to provoke a dire,
bone-chilling terror in their foes When you first encounter a
creature causing Terror, make a Cool Test If you pass, you suffer
no further effects of Terror; if you fail, you receive a number of
Broken conditions equal to the creature’s Terror Rating, plus the
number of SL below 0
After resolving the Psychology Test, the creature causes Fear,
with a Fear Rating equal to its Terror Rating
Custom Psychology
You can create your own psychological traits to reflect the events
of your game This is something that will vary depending on your
group, and the style of game you choose to play It is also an
area that should be treated sensitively, and if in any doubt avoid
anything that could upset a member of the group
In addition to the mechanical effects of these custom traits, they
are a wonderful opportunity for roleplaying; taking on custom
psychological traits allows you to show off or practice your
roleplaying skills, and maybe earn some extra XP See Advances
in Chapter 2: Character for more about this
When making custom traits, you should consider both what
provokes the trait to manifest, and what the effect will be Will
it make the character immune to some, or all other psychology
traits? Will it offer a bonus in some situations? A penalty in
others? As always, your GM is the ultimate arbiter in this
situation Sample bonuses or penalties a Psychological trait may
offer include:
	 +1/–1 SL to specified Tests
	 Immunity to specified psychological traits
	 Prescribed or Proscribed Actions and Moves
	 Gaining Conditions
The following are some examples of custom traits to inspire your
own
Example: Camaraderie
Camaraderie reflects positive feelings towards a group of
individuals
You must come to their aid if the group is threatened physically
or socially, and you gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Tests to defend
or support the group
Example: Amhold had a difficult childhood, growing up on the
streets without a family Despite his gruff demeanour, he has
Camaraderie (Orphans)
Example: Love
Poets write endlessly of love, and every minstrel of the Reikland
knows dozens of songs praising the power of love If your
character has the Love trait towards one or more individuals, this
reflects a deep and enduring emotional connection This may be
the intense romantic love for a wife, husband, or lover, a strong
familial love for a sibling, parent, or child, or an especially strong
friendship
You must come to the aid of someone you love if they are
threatened physically or socially You are immune to Fear and
Intimidation while defending your loved ones, and you gain a
bonus +1 SL to all related Tests
Example: Rilla is a riverwoman and travels the Reik with her
close-knit family She has Love (Son), Love (Brother) and Love
(Parents) You mess with Rilla’s family, you mess with Rilla!
Example: Phobia
A phobia reflects a specific fear; it may be towards a type of
creature, or towards a particular object or circumstance, such as
Phobia (Insects), Phobia (Books), or Phobia (Confined Spaces)
Treat the object of the Phobia as causing Fear 1 You may want
to increase the Fear rating if the Phobia is especially powerful
Example: Doktor Johannsen is a renowned antiquarian Despite
his many adventures and tales of derring-do, he suffers from
Phobia (Snakes); no matter this aversion, he seems to encounter
them with alarming regularity
Example: Trauma
The life of most Reiklanders is nasty, brutish and short: that goes
double for adventurers, whose lives are often especially traumatic
Everyone processes trauma differently, and you may choose to
reflect that in a range of different ways: nightmares, substance
abuse, flashbacks, Animosity or Hatred towards a particular group,
or a Phobia A character who has suffered a traumatic experience
may manifest that in a range of different ways over time
Example: Horst’s village was destroyed in a terrible fire – he
can still hear their screams at night If Horst sees any characters
— friend or foe — with the Ablaze Condition, he must make
a Challenging (+0) Cool Test If he fails, he receives a Stunned
Condition, plus one additional Stunned Condition for each SL
below 0 Additionally, every night Horst makes an Easy (+40)
Cool Test; if he fails, he suffers nightmares and gains the Fatigued
Condition

‘Of course there is something wrong with us This world has more
than enough sorrow and pain to go about So, what do we do?
We seek out things that even the courageous fear and confront
them in the dark Truly, we are the favoured pawns of the Gods
So: what do I do with my time when I’m not on some foolish
quest? I drink’
– Lieselotte Aderhold, Adventurer
It may take many game sessions, but eventually all adventures
come to an end When this happens, you may have weeks where
your character has nothing to do before the next adventure
begins This chapter provides tools to quickly detail what
happens in this downtime
To begin, you will randomise an Event You will then spend any
money you acquired on your last escapade, and engage in a variety
of activities called Endeavours, ranging from commonplace tasks
— such as working a trade, or managing their affairs — to more
specialised undertakings — such as consulting a sage or attempting
to learn a new skill Once this is concluded, you’ll resolve any
matters that arise from your choices, and are then ready to start
your next adventure
Options: It’s All Optional
Every rule in this chapter is optional Some will love the quick
rules it offers to explain events between adventures, others will
prefer to detail this time fully with roleplay, seeing it as as an
opportunity to give depth to characters or to pursue leads and
ideas that could become adventures in their own right There
is no right or wrong way Treat this chapter as a source of
inspiration and do your own thing!
Events
Before selecting your Endeavours, you first roll 1d100 on the
Events table opposite Some Events will only affect you, others
may affect the whole party
192
01–03: Accused Ally
One of your allies (GM’s choice) is implicated in a terrible
crime A character with a Law Guild Licence can spend an
Endeavour to free the ally with a successful Average (+20)
Lore (Law) test Otherwise, 3 Endeavours spent by the party
will exonerate their ally (or, if guilty, manufacture an alibi) If
the ally is freed, gain a Major Favour (see Do Me a Favour
Endeavour on page 198) for future use If not, their ally hangs!
04–06: Arcane Auction
The belongings of a recently deceased neighbour are
auctioned, including a dusty, old book of unknown origin
If you are able to pay the 10 GC asking price, the book is
yours! Beyond any other advantage the book may bring as
determined by the GM, any Academic characters attempting
the Research Lore Endeavour gains +20 on the Test
07–10: Betrayed!
A friend, family member, or ally turns on you, the
ramifications of which will impact your next adventure
If you have no friends, family, or allies, your time between
adventures is blissfully uneventful though somewhat dull
11–14: Bolt from the Blue
A lazy ostler didn’t lock the stable door, and your mount
bolted! If you succeed at an Average (+20) Animal Training
(Horse) Test, your well-trained beast returns to the hand that
feeds it If you fail, your steed is gone, unlikely to be ever seen
again If you don’t have a mount, you have developed a painful
new blister on your foot
15–18: Oi! You spilled my pint!
A petty argument in the local area has developed into a feud –
the GM decides who you offended and how This person will
not pass up an opportunity for petty revenge, probably during
the next adventure
19–21: Crime Crackdown
The Watch is cracking down on crime hard Rogues can
get no funds from the Income Endeavour, and if Rogues
undertake a Banking Endeavour, they may only select a
High-risk deposit, as legitimate banking houses won’t handle
dirty money
22–25: The Exciseman Cometh
An unexpected visit by the tax collector (with several
soldiers in tow) sweeps through your local settlement All
characters lose 30% of their funds before any can be spent
on Endeavours
26–29: False Silver
To the horror of the merchants, a run of counterfeit coins
plagues the characters’ locale A fifth of all coins are affected
Characters who undertake the Banking Endeavour will lose
20% of money banked, and characters undertaking the Income

37–40: Festivities
A celebration is called! Decide the nature of the event with
the GM Possibilities include a local wedding, a bountiful
harvest, or a public execution! You are caught up in the event
(and its aftermath) and lose an Endeavour
41–44: Inclement Weather
Particularly bad weather arrives For the next adventure, all
social Skill Tests suffer a penalty of –10 (everyone is in a foul
mood) and food prices increase by 20% (due to spoiling of
stored provender)
45–48: Glorious Weather
Beautiful conditions inspire you and give you cheer You can
add a new Short-term Ambition When it’s concluded, you
do not replace it with a new one
49–52: Local Crop Failure
Food becomes exceedingly scarce and many folk suffer
terribly Characters from the Peasant class cannot undertake
the Income Endeavour, and food prices are doubled in the
area for the duration of the next adventure

or if the party chooses to ignore the creature, it will move on
or be killed by a local rival
61–63: Morr’s Embrace
One of the character’s relatives, friends, or allies dies It
could be of natural causes, an accident, or the beginning of
something sinister…

The nights are particularly dark All Rogue characters
undertaking the Income Endeavour receive a +20% bonus to
their monies earned

You have a Major or Significant Favour called in Dealing
with the favour will be part of your next adventure and you
lose one Endeavour in preparation for what is to come

Passing soldiers, well-heeled merchants, or vacationing
nobles pass through the area, and characters willing to suck
up reap the benefits Burgher and Peasant Class characters

good sleep and fine cheese Be smugly content at the start of
your next adventure

raided, and all your money is taken If your money amounts
to less than 1 GC, the thieves also steal your most highlyvalued
trapping
80–82: Riots
The common folk are furious at the high and mighty!
Characters of the Courtier Class cannot take the Income
Endeavour as, no matter how many bodyguards they hire,
it isn’t even vaguely safe for them to be abroad on business
Further, any deposits at reputable banks (see page 196) must

caused their bank to go out of business However, players
attempting a Foment Dissent Endeavour receive +10 bonus

last adventure with
86–88: Suspicion of Heresy
You fall foul of a Witch Hunter who suspects you have been
consorting with Mutants, Cultists, or worse on your socalled
‘adventures’ It takes a Very Hard (-30) Charm Test
to convince the hunter you are innocent Failure to do this
means you have earned an implacable nemesis who is certain
to cause trouble in the future…

The party’s irregular movements and sudden wealth has
drawn suspicion All characters must forfeit one Endeavour
laying low or proving their innocence Characters in the
Rogue class cannot use the Income Endeavour until after

Little of interest occurs, perhaps leaving you with a boredominspired
appetite for taking risks!
95–97: Unexpected Esteem
Someone you helped in the past has a chance to repay your
efforts The precise nature of the reward should be appropriate
to your past deeds, and the NPCs you have assisted during
play or in your back story The tokens of gratitude may vary
from a single high-quality item, to a purse of silver (which
will be available at the start of the next adventure) Of course,
all that glitters is not gold, and not all gifts are what they
appear…
98–00: Unusual Mercenaries
One or more rare mercenaries turn up in a nearby settlement
looking for work: a Tilean Duellist of great repute, the socalled
Birdmen of Catrazza, unemployed Ogres under the
command of a Halfling captain, or other unlikely bands The
mercenaries will gladly train any character in any martial Skills
or Talents, at a 20% reduction in costs, should the characters
undertake a Training or Unusual Learning Endeavour
Additionally, any characters undertaking a Combat Training
Endeavour gain a +20 bonus to any relevant Test

Endeavours
In-between adventures, you have a selection of activities you
can undertake — these are known as Endeavours You may
undertake a maximum of one Endeavour per week you are
not adventuring, and you may attempt a maximum of three
Endeavours in total, regardless of how long the gap between
adventures may be The rest of your time, whether it be weeks,
months, or years, is taken up with living your life in relative
peace — whatever that may to look like to your character
While most of these Endeavours can be attempted by anyone,
some are better suited to a particular Class or Career
Year In, Year Out
If the period between adventures is particularly long, you can
discuss with the GM how to lengthen the narrative scope of
your Endeavours For instance, if you want to commission a
new sword with the Commission Endeavour, you may first
have to find a skilled smith, then the correct materials, then
wait for other commissions to be completed, then maybe your
sword is stolen, and so it goes on
Money to Burn
After you’ve rolled on the Event Table, you can spend the money
earned during your last adventures using the normal rules Then,
after completing your Endeavours, all money held by your
character is considered spent All of it The silver lifted from a
Burgher’s purse? Gone The booty liberated from pirates? Also
gone That Troll hoard you raided? Gone, too All of it
What happened to it? It was spent, stolen, drunk, gambled,
used for repairs, to pay off debts or taxes, given as a charitable
donations or votive offerings, spent on bribes, or used in whatever
other way you prefer You should concoct the best story for what
happens to those funds, as it explains a lot about your character
If you want to keep some of your hard-won coin to use in the
future, you should undertake the Banking Endeavour on page
196 If you want money at the beginning of the next adventure —
honestly, or otherwise, depending on your Career — you should
undertake the Income Endeavour on page 198
Duties & Responsibilities
You may lose one or more of your Endeavours due to your Career
or Species
With Great Power…
‘The common folk will never understand my burdens The sheer weight
of the duties I bear The guilty will not judge themselves and there are
always so many villages to cleanse, for our enemies are legion’
– Lothar Metzger, Witch Hunter
As you climb the ranks of your career, you accrue expectations
and responsibilities that cannot be avoided Noble Lords must
see to the affairs of their estates, Guildmasters must oversee their
guild’s work, and Watch Captains must watch their watchmen If
you neglect your responsibilities, you will soon lose status amongst
your peers
If you have attained one of the top two tiers of your Career Path
and do not undertake the Income Endeavour, which reflects
taking care of your obligations, you drop one level within your
Career; reverting from the fourth level to the third, or the third
to the second This costs no Experience Points, acting as a free
Career change, albeit downwards
With this step backwards in your Career Path, you will now have
a lower Status, and will earn less money should you perform
future Income Endeavours See Chapter 3: Class and Careers
for more about Status The loss in status does not remove any
Advances acquired while you were in your previous Career
If you wish to reclaim your lost Career level, you must once again
pay the XP cost to re-enter the higher level of your Career and
retake your ‘proper’ place in society
Elf Improvement
‘There are times when I can barely stand Altdorf It is not the stench
— though that is abhorrent — it is not the noise, either — it is just
that you are all so very ugly to look upon, I feel that I must gaze at
something beautiful for a time or I know that I shall start screaming,
and never stop’
– Irlianmaris Ellarel, Asur Envoy
Elves, even those resident within the borders of Empire, do
not consider themselves citizens of the Empire There are High
Elves with diplomatic positions in Karl-Franz I’s court, as well
as traders and merchant princes in many of the great cities of
the Empire, but the majority of the Asur avoid entanglements
with Humans (not to mention Dwarfs) and few would call a
Reiklander ‘friend’
The Wood Elves are even more removed; nearly mythical, rarely
seen, and when they do appear they always have their own
concerns that they rarely share with others

Elf Esteem
You will note high-ranking Elven characters who do not wish
to lose Career status will only be able to undertake a single
‘free’ Endeavour This is intentional, designed to offset some
of the innate advantages Elven Characters receive, as well as
reflecting the prolonged time it takes the long-lived Elves
to adapt to change Of course, if you feel this is unfairly
penalising an Elf character, or making the game less fun,
ignore one or both restrictions
Between adventures, all Elven characters must undertake one
Endeavour maintaining contact with their own kind, seeing to
their responsibilities to their people High Elves commonly give
reports on interesting things they’ve learned to agents of Ulthuan
in either Altdorf or Marienburg, whereas Asrai do the same with
the spies from their arboreal homes This Endeavour offers no
advantage beyond the inherent advantage of being an Elf Note:
Elves only lose an Endeavour if the Between Adventures section
is at least 3 weeks long, thus the Elves have at least 3 Endeavours
to complete
General Endeavours
Below you will find details of the Endeavours any character may
undertake between adventures
Flying Solo
Endeavours are designed to be undertaken by individual
characters, but if there are reasons for more members of the
group to be involved, do roleplay these situations Equally,
some of the Endeavours may present natural starting points for
new adventures For instance, if a player loses all their funds in
a Banking Endeavour, where did the money go? And did the
thieves leave any clues…?
Animal Training
You spend time training one of your animals Make an Average
(+20) Animal Training Test If successful, add one skill to your
animal from the Trained Creature Trait (see page 342)
Banking
This Endeavour allows you to store funds for future use As noted
in Money to Burn, all coin remaining at the end of your ‘Between
Adventures’ phase is lost before the next adventure begins unless
it is saved with this Endeavour So, if you have a lot of money
spare it may be worth a trip to the bank If you are using a
Banking Endeavour to retain your money, you must first decide
whether to save your money by investing it with a reputable
banking institution, or to stash it somewhere less secure
Investing: You must be of the Gold and Silver social tiers to save
with a banking house Your money will be reasonably safe and it
should accrue interest When undertaking a Banking Endeavour
to deposit money in a bank, determine the interest rate of your
account, by choosing a number between 1 and 10 (alternatively
you may simply roll 1d10) This is the rate of interest you will
accrue, and also how risky the investment is Withdrawing
funds requires another Banking Endeavour This may take place
immediately after the initial Endeavour, or after subsequent
adventures have occurred Roll 1d100: if you roll equal to or less
than your rate of interest, the venture has gone bankrupt and you
have lost all of your money If you roll over the interest rate, you
receive your initial funds, plus the interest accrued
Stashing: All characters may choose to stash their loot This
is a risky strategy, involving hiding it on your person, in your
mattress, or burying it somewhere Stashed money never accrues
any interest Players may withdraw money from a stash before the
start of an adventure, without undertaking an Endeavour Roll
1d100: if you roll 10 or lower, your stash has been found and you
have lost all your money, otherwise you recieve your initial funds
If you successfully withdraw your funds they will be available for
you when you start your next adventure, in addition to any funds
secured via an Income Endeavour
Example: Gerhard and Ulli’s courage in the face of a Greenskin
horde (not to mention some judicious looting) has earned them
a haul worth 10 gold crowns each The ever-prudent Gerhard
decides to place his money with the esteemed banking house
Bent, Crooke & Scarper The GM rolls 1d10 with a result of 6
Gerhard will earn 6% interest on his deposit (12 silver shillings,
see page 288), and the bank will fail if he rolls 6 or less on d100
when he tries to make a withdrawal
Ulli — a gambler at heart — buries his money near a mile-marker
on the road to Ubersreik He doesn’t need to make an Endeavour
to get access to his loot, but tragically he rolls 07 when he tries to
recover it, and finds nothing but freshly disturbed earth, an empty
chest, and whole heap of regret
Changing Career
In a society as rigidly hierarchical as the Empire, changing
Careers may require grit and perseverance Taking time to forge
the right connections, and learn what is expected of you, can help,
significantly Assuming you GM agrees, and you have completed
VI
196
you current Career, you can move to any Career Level that fits
the story of your Character for free If you have not completed
your current Career, the change costs 100 XP The time spent on
this Endeavour represents making the appropriate introductions,
doling out bribes, acquiring permits and licences, advertising, and
similar activities
Commission
So, you wish to own one of Von Meinkopt’s legendary repeating
pistols? Or a custom helm, with a personalised crest representing
your epic victories? The Commission Endeavour allows you to
acquire unusual or highly specialized items that are never simply
‘stocked’ in the shops of the Empire It also allows for you to
arrange for the creation of unique items Such things take time,
though…
If you are seeking an item with an Exotic rarity and know a
source capable of acquiring or manufacturing it, then undertake
this Endeavour, spend the necessary funds, and place your
order The item will then be ready for collection after your next
adventure A character can only commission a single Exotic item
per Endeavour; acquiring further items, will require undertaking
further Commission Endeavours If you are unaware of an
appropriate source for their item, you will first have to undertake
the Consult an Expert Endeavour
Consult an Expert
The Old World is replete with ancient and arcane knowledge, yet
this information is not readily available on some magical box in
your pocket If you want to seek out some piece of obscure arcana,
you must first seek out an expert You may undertake the Consult
an Expert Endeavour either to facilitate another Endeavour
for example: Commission, Training, or Unusual Learning
Endeavours), or to secure a piece of specific knowledge
There are two stages to this Endeavour: locating the expert, then
consulting
First, you must locate your expert (this stage may be skipped with
the GM’s permission if you have already identified an appropriate
expert during your adventures) Attempt a Challenging (+0)
Gossip Test (the Difficulty of this Test will vary according to the
size of the settlement where your character is currently living) If
you succeed, you have located your expert If you fail, you have
located the loudest self-proclaimed specialist in your location,
and the GM is given free rein to vary the quality or accuracy
of the advice procured You can of course refuse to deal with
this somewhat suspect source, but you never know if you might
have found a diamond in the rough GMs are contrary like that
sometimes
Once successfully locate an expert, you then need to convince
them to talk with you Depending on what you wish to know,
this may require no more than a Simple Charm Test or a modest
donation to the local Temple of Verena In more extreme cases,
you may have to commit to performing one or more Favours
(see Do Me A Favour!) which may be called in during a future
adventure, or ‘bought off ’ by spending Endeavours between
future adventures The level of Favour owed depends on the
complexity — and danger — of the information you want as
determined by the GM
The precise nature of the information gleaned depends on the
expert consulted and what you seek to know Academics will
know the origins and full history on a subject with which they
are familiar; Magisters of the Colleges of Magic in Altdorf
understand the history of magic and various mystical objects,
particularly aspects relevant to their own order; an Apothecary
General can identify even the rarest poison; a Verenan scholar
may have information relating to any number of historical
incidents In short, the expert’s background will influence how
the knowledge is presented, and with which biases
In addition to any specific information the GM imparts to
their player, a successful Consult an Expert Endeavour used to
seek out knowledge (and not to facilitate another Endeavour)
gives you an Expert Reroll (mark this on your character sheet
under Notes) This reroll may only be used on a Test specifically
relating to the lore revealed and must be used before the end of
your next adventure
Crafting
Rather than browse shops or commissioning someone else to
do the hard work, you can fashion your own trappings Crafting
allows you to make any trapping from Chapter 11: Consumers’
Guide (or anything else the GM allows) if you have the correct
Trade Skills To do this, you require appropriate Trade Tools, raw
materials, and access to an appropriate workshop In general, the
raw materials to create the trapping of your choice will cost a
quarter of the trapping’s list price, and must be purchased before
Crafting begins (with an Availability as determined by the GM);
the GM may rule the raw materials are cheaper or more expensive
according to the trapping to be created, and the nature of the raw
materials required
Custom Gear
With a GM’s permission, a character may undertake two
(or more) consecutive Commission Endeavours to acquire
even more unusual items: personal commissions from the
Engineering Guild, a rare and virulent poison, or a magically
ensorcelled item The prices for such things generally range
from ‘very high’ to ‘staggering’ and may well involve a Favour
or two (see Do Me a Favour! ) or even an entire adventure to
acquire raw materials
Bet ween Adventures VI
197
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
To craft the trapping, attempt an Extended Trade Test, with
a Difficulty set by the GM, typically using the Trapping’s
Availability as a loose guide
Availability Difficulty
Common Average (+20)
Scarce Challenging (+0)
Rare Difficult (–10)
Exotic Very Hard (–30)
The number of SL required to succeed at the Test is also set by
the GM, using the listed price for the trapping in the Consumers’
Guide as a reference
The SL required is further modified by the Qualities or Flaws
you work into the trapping Each Flaw halves the SL required,
and each Quality adds +5 (worked out after halving for Flaws)
Each Endeavour you spend Crafting allows you to make one
roll towards your Extended Test Unfinished work can be kept
in whatever you have that amounts to lodgings, or carried around
with you as you adventure, should that be possible

Income
This Endeavour covers the many ways you can make money
between your bouts of adventuring The majority will most likely
work in a recognized profession — bounty hunters hunt bounties,
riverwardens ward rivers, troll slayers slay Trolls — others may
rely on a lucrative skill Wealthier characters, such as Nobles and
Merchants, might collect a stipend by (briefly) indulging their
VI
198
Do Me a Favour!
A Favour is a future burden you take on in return for immediate assistance of some sort In the Old World, breaking one’s sworn
word is considered bad form and carries significant social ramifications No-one trusts oath breakers, meaning your Status is reduced
by 1 (see page 49) Powerful and dangerous folks tend to take it very, very poorly if someone refuses a Favour owed them, so bloody
consequences may follow
The powerful often find it is far more useful to have various individuals owing them Favours than merely soliciting money in return for
their help What’s more, it can be an investment: help a student today, call in a favour from a successful Lawyer years later Favours may
be referred to as ‘boons’, ‘services’, or ‘obligations’ by different folk, but in the end, they all amount to the same
Favours come in three levels: Minor, Major, and Significant Regardless of a Favour’s level, in almost all cases, the person owed the
Favour will take into account the capabilities and sensibilities of the person they’re asking There’s no point in demanding that a Priestess
of Shallya assassinate a merchant, for example, even if she does owe you a Significant Favour That being said, Favours are ripe for
NPCs to exploit in order to put pressure on your moral compass
	 A Minor Favour represents a simple task that can be completed in no more than a few hours Perhaps you need volunteer at a
Shallyan mercy-house or put in a good word for someone With the GM’s permission, you may undertake an Endeavour to pay
off this favour
	 A Major Favour is a more time-consuming or risky undertaking It could take up to several weeks to achieve and may involve travel
Perhaps you are needed to act as lookout on a string of burglaries, to convince the Stevedores’ and Teamsters’ Guild to back
down from a guild war, or to transport a package to a different city With the GM’s permission, you may undertake two or more
consecutive Endeavours to pay off this favour
	 A Significant Favour is relatively rare and will almost certainly involve risking life and limb Months of travel may be involved, and
major violence is likely Perhaps you will be asked to eliminate a rival gang boss, wipe out a Goblin encampment, or instigate a
riot Significant Favours cannot be paid off via Endeavours; they are roleplayed out as full adventures 
family, or collecting interest on their investments and business
ventures Roguish types have any number of means to acquire
funds, though it’s best not to ask for any details
You should briefly narrate exactly how your character makes
money This is intended more for fun background detail than
to have any direct consequences, though GMs may well gather
useful or sinister ideas for future use depending on what you
describe You then acquire the income you’ll start your next
adventure with, which is your standard income determined by
your Status (see page 51) Certain results on the Events Table
on page 193 may directly affect your income The money you get
from an Income Endeavour is given to you after your money from
the last adventure is spent (see Money to Burn)
In addition to acquiring funds for later use, if you are in the third
or fourth level of a Career and undertake this Endeavour, you
automatically maintain your standing in your career See With
Great Power… on page 195 for details
Invent!
Invent allows you to invent new trappings This is done in two
stages: Plan and Build To Plan your new trapping, you first decide
the trappings you wish to combine to create your invention As
examples, Pistols have been combined with other Pistols to
create Repeating Pistols, and Pigeons and been combined with
Bombs to create Pigeon Bombs Let your imagination go wild
Once you have your plan, it’s time to make the blueprints, which
costs 1 Endeavour to attempt Take a Trade (Engineer) Test,
with a Difficulty set by how outlandish your proposed trapping
combination is as determined by the GM If you succeed, you
are ready to start Building Each SL scored adds +1 SL to the
attempt to build your invention, as the plans are well laid out and
easy to follow
To Build the invention, you must either undertake a Crafting
or Commission Endeavour If it’s Crafting, you are building the
item yourself, and you must have the appropriate Skills to do
so for the trappings being combined; so, if you were combining
Pigeons with Bombs, you would need Animal Training and
Trade (Explosives) The Difficulty to craft the invention is always
Very Hard (–30), and the SL is set as normal The raw materials
needed to build the invention cost twice the listed price for the
trappings being combined, and have an Availability rating equal
to the most scarce of the trappings used in your invention If
you Commission the invention, you will likely need to undertake
a Consult an Expert Endeavour first to find someone with the
required Skills That done, follow the Commission Endeavour as
normal; it costs six times the listed price for the trappings to be
combined to commission the work The exact rules for your new
invention are left to your GM to finalise
Training
The Training Endeavour allows you to train in a Skill or
Characteristic outside of your Career, treating it as if it were inCareer
In addition to the normal XP cost, you must also pay
money to the tutor Training for Basic Skills and all Characteristics
costs XP+1d10 brass pennies , where XP is the number of XP it
costs to buy the Advance Tutoring in all Advanced Skills costs
double that amount For more, see Advances, see page 43
You should be able to find a tutor for most skills, certainly in a
city-state like Altdorf, but some particularly unusual skills may
require you seek out the right instructor, likely by using the
Consult an Expert Endeavour — ‘Professionals’ who can teach
you how to properly pick a lock generally don’t advertise, after all
Other skills, especially Lore Skills, often require an institution of
learning, and some are flat out forbidden in the Empire Finding
a tutor capable (and willing) to instruct someone in proscribed
matters — such as those relating to the Ruinous Powers or
Necromancy — may be particularly dangerous, and perhaps an
adventure to even source such an individual Such tutors will also
ask for far more than the ‘going rate’ for tutoring and will likely
require a Significant Favour (see Do Me A Favour!)
Unusual Learning
It is one thing to pick up a Skill that can be readily practised,
quite another to learn something for which one may have no
aptitude at all This Endeavour allows you to attempt to learn a
Talent outside of your Career There is no guarantee this attempt
will be successful, meaning there is a good chance you will fail to
learn the Talent you hope to acquire, expending XP and money
to no avail
Bet ween Adventures
199
VI
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
You can only learn a Talent if you have an appropriate tutor In
most big cities, this will not be a problem, but if the Talent is
particularly obscure, or you are far from a large city, the GM may
require you complete a Consult an Expert Endeavour first
Once you have acquired a tutor, the fee to train the Talent is 2d10
shillings per 100 XP it costs to purchase the Talent If you pay
this fee, attempt a Hard (-20) Test using the Characteristic or
Skill most relevant to the Talent as determined by the GM If you
succeed, you have learned the Talent If not, you have failed this
time but can try again with a future Endeavour and gain a +10
modifier for each failed attempt
Class Endeavours
Class Endeavours tend to be simpler than General Endeavours
and often offer benefits more suited to characters in specific
Classes Any character can undertake any Class Endeavour, but
if you don’t currently belong to the Classes specified under the
Endeavour, any Tests you take are one Difficulty Level harder —
so, Hard (–20) instead of Difficult (–10), for example
Combat Training
Rangers, Warriors
Warriors too long from the field can find their fighting skills lose
their edge Hard regular training not only mitigates this, it can
add an extra advantage when the time comes If you undertake
this Endeavour, you spend your days training with the weapons
you know, honing your skills for the day when it matters most
After undertaking this Endeavour, attempt a Challenging (+0)
Test using either a Melee or Ranged Skill If you succeed, you
may reverse a Test with the associated Skill once during your next
adventure Note this on your character sheet You can enact this
Endeavour multiple times if you wish
Foment Dissent
Burghers, Peasants
If you are looking to sow civil unrest, undertake the Foment
Dissent Endeavour By talking with local citizens, leading
meetings, and involving yourself, you can direct conversations to
slowly feed anger and resentment towards a specific individual,
group, or institution But this takes time, so Fomenting Dissent
takes two Endeavours to attempt (and will also count as an
Income Endeavour if you are in the Agitator career)
To undertake the Endeavour, you must first attempt an Average
(+20) Gossip Test to understand the local movers and shakers
If you succeed, attempt a Charm Test with the Difficulty
determined by how unpopular the target may be Rousing anger
against an oppressive noble may be an Easy (+40) test, while
raising a mob to protest the good work of a Shallyan hospice may
be Hard (–20) If you fail either of these tests, the Endeavour
fails
If successful, you will find it easier to invoke the wrath of crowds
upon your chosen target During your next adventure, you can
attempt a Charm Test to gather a rioting mob to accost the
target, with the difficulty determined by the GM according to
how well-planned the mob-to-be is
A single success means you gather enough angered townsfolk
to confront the target, shouting insults, demanding justice,
throwing rotting vegetables, and generally accosting the focus
of their ire An Impressive or Astounding Success may lead to
uncontrollable lynch mobs, or even attempted burnings!
VI
Failure means folk have no stomach for wrath; failing by several
SL may mean the target, or their sympathisers, become aware
of your actions…
Once you have the ear of a mob (successfully undertaking this
Endeavour), you can attempt to rally the mob against a different
target during an adventure, although this is more difficult, and
the Difficulty of the Charm Test is two levels higher
The Latest News
Rangers, Riverfolk
This Endeavour allows you to learn the latest news from afar
Attempt a Challenging (+0) Gossip Test If you succeed, you
learn an interesting rumour; each SL adds another rumour, and
they may even be connected to your upcoming adventure If
you fail particularly badly (an Impressive Failure) you learn
something false you are convinced is true; to allow this, the GM
may make this roll in secret on your behalf
Reputation
Academics, Burghers, Courtiers
Money talks, as they say If you are looking to exert your influence
and elevate your Status, you had best be willing to spread your
wealth around Any boost to your reputation will fade once the
coins stop flowing, so you should exploit this advantage while it
lasts
Characters can spend money to increase their Standing by +1
for the next adventure, after which the bonus fades This costs
your maximum Earning income (see page 52) — so, if you
would normally earn 4d10 pennies, it costs 40d — and requires
a Challenging (+0) Career Skill Test If you succeed, your
Standing increases by +1 If you score an Astounding Success
(+6), it increases by +2 If you fail, you have just wasted your
money If you score an Astounding Failure (–6), your toadying
has so infuriated your peers, your standing decreases by -1 (to a
minimum of 0) for the entire duration of your next adventure
Research Lore
Academics
This Endeavour allows you to seek greater knowledge
concerning a specific subject, such as the site of a battle, a famed
historical event, or an individual The character must have access
to an appropriate storehouse of lore, such as a library, the annals
of a Dwarf Hold, the records of a Guild, or a Temple of Verena
Attempt an Average (+20) Lore Test, using the appropriate
Lore Specialisation for the knowledge you seek If you do not
have the correct Lore Specialisation and are literate, you can
still attempt to learn something, but it will take a Difficult
(–10) Intelligence Test If you succeed, you learn one piece
of interesting, useful, or hidden knowledge about the subject
researched; each SL adds another piece of relevant information
If you fail particularly badly (an Impressive or Astounding
Failure)) you learn something false that you are convinced is
true; to facilitate this, the GM may want to make this role in
secret on your behalf
Study a Mark
Rogues
You use this Endeavour to observe a potential target and gain
advantages during future criminal enterprises A Charlatan may
study a merchant in order to better impersonate them during a
future scam, or a Grave Robber may linger about a Temple of
Morr, watching the coming and going of the priests to get an
idea of their practices and their Garden of Morr’s layout
Attempt a Challenging (+0) Perception Test, though the
difficulty may be modified for especially easy or difficult marks If
you succeed, you may reverse a Test concerning your mark once
during your next adventure Note this on your character sheet You
can enact this Endeavour multiple times if you wish Further, the
GM should provide information (or disinformation!) concerning
your mark according to the SL you scored

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
 Religi on and Belief 
Signs of religion are everywhere in the Old World, from the
magnificent temples in the great cities to the humble wayside
shrines and household altars Old Worlders do their best to stay
on the right side of their gods
High-ranking clerics are wealthy and powerful, wielding as much
influence and prestige as the greatest nobles At the other end
of the scale, village priests tend to the spiritual needs of rural
communities, preaching the tenets of their faith and interceding
with their patron deities on behalf of their flocks Several faiths
also support templar orders: these private armies of priestsoldiers
answer to the head of their faith rather than to any noble
or elector count, which can cause significant political friction
The Gods
The people of the Old World recognise many deities Some
are worshipped across the whole of the Old World; some are
restricted to one nation or region; and some are patrons of just a
single town or occupation
Gods of the Empire
In the Empire, the pantheon of gods is split into three broad
categories: the Old Gods, the Classical Gods, and the Provincial
Gods Standing apart from these is Sigmar, the first Emperor, and
patron deity of the Empire as a whole
The Old Gods
The Old Gods refer to the pantheon of deities worshipped when
the Empire was unbroken forest populated by wandering tribes of
barbarians Many Old Gods stood as patrons to one of the tribes,
and to this day some are still associated with the old geographical
hunting grounds of those ancient peoples Although few say so
out loud, many citizens of the Empire regard the Old Gods as
the true deities of the Empire, and the Classical Gods as relative
newcomers
As time passed, five gods rose to prominence amongst the Old
Gods, worshipped by dominant cults spread from one end of
the Empire to the other: Ulric, Taal, Rhya, Manaan, and Morr,
representing the primal spheres of war, nature, fertility, seas, and
death
The Classical Gods
The Classical Gods spread from the southern lands of Tilea,
Estalia, and the Border Princes through trade and diplomatic
contact Today, their worship is popular in the cosmopolitan
towns and cities, and some nobles and townsfolk secretly regard
them as more sophisticated than the Old Gods — though few
would risk voicing such opinions aloud!
The most widespread cults of Classical Gods in the Empire are
dedicated to Verena, Myrmidia, Shallya, and Ranald, patrons of
wisdom, strategy, mercy, and trickery Hiding behind these, there
is also Khaine, the God of Murder, though his cult is outlawed
in most places
The Provincial Gods
The Empire hosts a wide variety of deities — patrons of
provinces, towns, forests, lakes, rivers, crafts, and much more
besides Formed into complicated pantheons by local legends
and myths, the Provincial Gods often have small cults dedicated
to them, but few have much influence However, there are
exceptions: standing high above other Provincial Gods, worship
of Handrich, the God of Trade, has spread significantly with
commerce and now boasts a significant cult-presence amongst
the Empire’s rising merchant class
Sigmar
Sigmar founded the Empire over two-thousand years ago, and
his legend recounts how he conquered unthinkable foes and
overcame impossible odds Reigning for fifty years, he eventually
abdicated and turned east to return his magical warhammer,
Ghal-Maraz, to its forgers: his old allies, the Dwarfs He was
never seen again Not long after, oracles and prophets claimed
Sigmar had ascended to godhood, invested by Ulric before the
entire pantheon of old gods and new
Today, many centuries later, the cult of Sigmar, patron of the
Empire, has spread to such an extent that its leader, the Grand
Theogonist, is arguably more powerful than the emperor himself
Other Pantheons
The different countries and species of the Old World all have
deities of their own Some, according to theologians, are aspects
of other deities worshipped under different names Others are
VII
202
particularly revered by a particular species: examples include
Grungni, the Dwarfen God of Mining and Dwarf Pride; Isha, a
Goddess of Fertility and Nature who is seen as the mother of all
Elves; and Esmerelda, the Halfling Goddess of Hearth, Home,
and Family
The Chaos Gods
The Daemonic gods of the Realms of Chaos are the greatest
threat to the Old World, each determined to bring absolute
ruin to the mortal realm Their worship by lost and damned
souls is pervasive and clandestine, with uncounted dark cultists
infiltrating all levels of society Khorne, Nurgle, Tzeentch, and
Slaanesh: Gods of Rage, Despair, Ambition, and Excess Few
dare whisper their twisting names, for they harbour malevolent
power, and leave mutation and horror in their wake
The Cults
The Old World has many cults dedicated to appeasing or
appealing to deities and promoting the ideals they embody
Leaders of these cults are frequently influential in local politics
They not only stand as representatives of their gods, but also
command hundreds or perhaps thousands of clerics and templars:
temporal power that cannot be ignored
To manage their numerous members, most of the larger cults are
split into orders, many of which operate from significant holy
sites or temples
Orders
Most Old World cults are split into orders, with each order
focussing on different aspects of their god’s concerns Orders
come in many different forms, including monastic orders of
monks or nuns, templar orders of knights, priestly orders that
attend to holy needs in the community, and mendicant orders of
friars that wander the Old World, usually subsisting from alms
Each order is organised differently according to individual cult
law and tradition, but in all cases they swear allegiance to the
head of their cult, not the local nobility
Holy Sites
The cults maintain holy sites across the Old World, many of
them associated with legendary deeds of the gods from mythical
times Most are protected by buildings such as temples, abbeys,
chapterhouses, or monasteries Some older sites, or those not
so well known, may only be marked by a shrine or unattended
chapel Cult buildings are usually decorated beautifully inside
and out with scenes from the religion’s mythology They vary
widely in size and layout and often follow regional styles of
architecture Some hold extreme wealth, especially in the towns
and cities where a more affluent population provides greater
tithes Larger cult buildings support dozens of people, including
lay craftspeople, guards, and servants, while smaller sites are run
by a handful of staff aided by volunteers from the community
In villages, a single priest is the norm, supported by the faithful
Shrines and chapels are more modest affairs, the size of a oneroom
house or smaller They do not normally have a full-time
priest, although they may come under the charge of a nearby
Gods of Reikland
Like all of the grand provinces, Reikland has a wide array of Provincial Gods, some even boasting small, sophisticated cults The following
provides an example of some of these

temple or — especially in rural areas — a wandering priest
who travels from one village and shrine to another In a priest’s
absence, local villagers pray unsupervised, leave small offerings,
and keep the shrine in good repair
Options: Little Prayers
Prayers to the gods are rarely answered by those not Blessed
(see page 134), but the gods do listen sometimes Prayers
offered in holy sites have a chance of receiving divine attention
If the offering, circumstances, and motivation are appropriate,
the GM may secretly roll d100 to see if your prayers are
heeded On a roll of 01, they are If you have the Pray Skill,
the GM may increase that chance When such prayers are
answered, the results may not be exactly what you expect — the
gods of the Old World do not simply grant wishes — but it
will almost always be something that will help you achieve a
goal that is important to the deity This might be a bonus
to a dice roll, or a one-shot use of a Skill or Prayer that is
otherwise unavailable, or some other advantage
Primary Cults of the Empire
Although many hundreds of gods are worshipped across the
Empire, ten are of particular importance, each worshipped by
cults spanning the grand provinces and granted a special position
by Magnus the Pious over two-hundred years ago
The Grand Conclave
When Emperor Magnus the Pious rebuilt the Empire after the
Great War Against Chaos, he realised previous schisms and civil
wars besetting his realm were often sourced in religious unrest
To help prevent this happening again, Magnus created the
Grand Conclave, a meeting of the primary cults in the Empire
held every five years to air grievances and discuss resolutions,
with the emperor sitting as chair
Though enormously controversial at the time, the Grand
Conclave is now fully accepted, and is held alongside great
celebrations and festivities, with the representatives of the
following gods required to attend: Manaan, Morr, Myrmidia,
Ranald, Rhya, Shallya, Sigmar, Taal, Ulric, and Verena Although
other influential cults exist — such as the Cult of Handrich,
which is currently lobbying for a seat on the Conclave — the
ten currently sitting are widely perceived as the most important
in the Empire

Seat of Power: Marienburg, the Wasteland
Head of the Cult: Matriarch of the Sea
Primary Orders: Order of the Albatross, Order of the Mariner
Major Festivals: Spring Equinox, Autumn Equinox
Popular Holy Books: The 1000 Shanties, Tales of the Albatross,
Liber Manaan
Common Holy Symbols: Five-tined Crown, Waves, Anchors
Volatile Manann, the son of Taal and Rhya, is the capricious King
of the Sea, Master of the Maelstroms, and Summoner of Storms
Known for his black moods and erratic temper, folk claim his cult
is needed more than any other, for if ever there is a god that must
be appeased, it’s Manaan He’s depicted as an enormous, blackbearded
man with seaweed in his hair and a great, five-pointed
crown of black iron upon his troubled brow He’s said to dwell
at the bottom of the ocean, the rise and fall of his massive chest
forming the waves and tides as the greatest monsters of the deep
gather in his court
Worshippers
Manann is worshipped along coasts throughout the Old World,
wherever people make their living from the sea or live close
enough for storms and floods to threaten their homes Even
those who know little of Manann will throw a coin or other small
treasure into the water before beginning a sea voyage in the hope
of a smooth crossing
The cult has a significant number of orders, mostly monastic,
tasked to guard isolated, sacred islands The Order of the Albatross
is largest, comprised of priests who maintain temples across
the Old World and bless merchant or naval vessels with their
presence Often accompanying them, the Order of the Mariner
is the military arm of Manann, the cult’s templar-marines, sworn
protectors of Marienburg
Manann’s clerics usually wear robes of dark greenish-blue or
blue-grey, trimmed with a white wave-pattern
Holy Sites
Manann’s temples are found in all coastal towns and cities, and in
most river ports where seagoing vessels berth The high temple is
in the great port-city of Marienburg: a huge, lavishly decorated
complex open to the tides The Matriarch of the Sea, head of the
Order of the Albatross, is based there, a woman who
ostensibly leads the entire cult of Manann, although
in practice the sea-god’s clerics are as mercurial as
their god, and as likely to be stubborn as to serve
The cult also maintains many monasteries and abbeys
on small isolated islands, most dedicated to one of
Manann’s many saints
Penances
Penances from Manann often involve hazardous, maritime
pilgrimages, tests of sailing skills, or expeditions against the
sea-god’s enemies, especially followers of the heretical cult of
Stromfels, God of Pirates, Wreckers, and Sharks
Strictures
 No whistling or swearing when at sea or on holy ground
 Never harm an albatross
 First catch to Manann

Seat of Power: Luccini, Tilea
Head of the Cult: Custode del Portale
Primary Orders: Order of the Shroud, Order of the Black
Guard, Order of the Augurs
Major Festivals: Hexensnacht, Geheimisnacht
Popular Holy Books: The Book of Doorways, Libro Dei Morti,
Thernodies of the Raven
Common Holy Symbols: Portals, Ravens, Black Roses
Urbane Morr, God of Death and King of the Underworld, is
husband to Verena, brother to murderous Khaine, and father of
Myrmidia and Shallya He sends divine ravens to guide dead
souls to the Portal, the pillared gateway between the mortal
realms and the realm of the gods He then leads each soul from
there to its final resting place: either Morr’s Underworld, or the
afterlife of another god He is commonly portrayed as a tall, darkhaired
man of aristocratic bearing, with a brooding, intense air
Worshippers
Outside Ostermark, where Morr has special importance, few
wish to attract the God of Death’s attention, so normally only the
bereaved pray to him However, those desperate or brave enough
may pray for dreams of what the future may bring, though it is
said he rarely divulges anything not associated with dying
The Order of the Shroud dominates the cult, directly controlling
all other orders and the Mourners’ Guild, those responsible for
overseeing burials and burial grounds Supporting them, the
Black Guard are the cult’s largest templar order, tasked to
guard temples and hunt down the Undead The Order
of Augurs may be small, but it guides the leadership
with its foretellings, and organises the Order of
Doomsayers: these wandering priests of Morr tour the
land performing Doomings for all Human children
on their tenth year Bringing them all together, every
decade a grand convocation of the priesthood of Morr is
held at Luccini in Tilea, where the future for the cult is
discussed around city-wide festivities
All Morr’s clerics wear plain, black, hooded robes
without adornment or trimming
Holy Sites
Temples of Morr are within Gardens of Morr: great graveyards
wrapped with black roses that bloom all year, and are rarely used
for anything other than funeral services Most are plain structures
of dark stone, distinguished by a broad doorway with a heavy
lintel-stone — representing Morr’s Portal The doors are always
open, like the doors to the Kingdom of Death Inside, the temples
are bare Any necessary furniture and other equipment is kept in
storage until it is needed for a funeral service Shrines to Morr also
take the form of a gateway, usually consisting of two plain pillars
and a lintel In some cases, one pillar is white marble and the other
black basalt
Penances
Morr’s penances typically involve hunting Necromancers and
destroying Undead, or finding and restoring burial places and holy
sites fallen to disuse and disrepair He also occasionally requires
servants of Khaine be stopped from fulfilling their dark deeds
Strictures
 Respect and protect the dead
 Hunt down Necromancers and the Undead wherever
they may gather
 Pay heed to your dreams
 Never refuse to conduct a funeral service
 At no time be a party to raising the dead, unless
allowed by Morr

The Cult of Morr, God of Death
206
Seat of Power: Magritta, Estalia
Head of the Cult: La Aguila Ultima
Primary Orders: Order of the Eagle, Order of the Righteous
Spear, Order of the Blazing Sun
Major Festivals: None in the Empire
Popular Holy Books: Bellona Myrmidia, Bellum Strategia,
The Book of War
Common Holy Symbols: Spear behind a shield, eagles, suns
In the Empire, bronzed Myrmidia, daughter of Verena and
Morr, sister of Shallya, is the Goddess of Strategy and Scientific
Warfare However, in the sun-drenched south, Myrmidia is
much more than this: she acts as the patron deity of both the
Estalian Kingdoms and the Tilean City States, and is fanatically
worshipped in both realms Because of this, her cult is the largest
in the Old World, for all it has a limited presence in the Empire
She is commonly portrayed as a tall, muscular, young woman
armed and equipped in archaic, southern stylings She is known
for her calm, honourable approach to all matters, and her clerics
do what they can to emulate this
Worshippers
Myrmidia grants generals the insight to win battles with
minimal losses, and soldiers the skill-at-arms to defeat enemies
quickly and without significant losses Because of this, her
cult is steadily growing among the armies and garrisons of the
Empire, especially in the Reikland, Averland, and Wissenland
In the Empire, the cult has three orders of significance The
Order of the Eagle tends to the temples and their surrounding
communities, and is led from Nuln by the ‘Eagle of the North’,
the most powerful Myrmidian north of the Vaults The templar
Order of the Righteous Spear has a chapterhouse attached to
each of these temples, each commanded by the local high priest
A second templar order, the Order of the Blazing Sun, is the
oldest Myrmidian order in the Empire, and works independently
of the Order of the Eagle
Myrmidia’s clerics in the Empire normally wear blue cowls over
white robes with red edging, with her symbol either sewn onto
the left breast or worn as a cloak-clasp
Holy Sites
Most of Myrmidia’s holy sites are found in Estalia and Tilea,
and are associated with the goddess’s campaigns across those
realms when she manifested as a mortal over two-thousand years
ago In the Empire, the goddess has much less of a presence,
with temples only in major towns and cities, and only a single
monastic order cloistered in the Monastery of the Black Maiden in
Wissenland Temples to Myrmidia tend to follow the architectural
styles of Tilea and Estalia, with domed roofs covering square or
rectangular halls Their exteriors are often carved with low reliefs
showing battle scenes or tableaux of weapons and shields Shrines
may take the form of miniature temples, statues of the goddess,
or free-standing sculptures of stacked weapons, shields, and
armour Myrmidia’s holy sites are also known for their scandalous
depictions of the goddess and her saints, who are often presented
wearing little more than scarves about their waists, which many
Sigmarites find completely unacceptable
Penances
Penances from Myrmidia are usually military in nature A cultist
may be ordered to defeat an enemy champion in single combat,
or to train a group of peasants and lead them in the defence of
their village Protecting pilgrimage routes to sites of importance
to Myrmidia are also not uncommon
Strictures
 Act with honour and dignity in all matters
 Respect prisoners of war, and never kill an enemy who
surrenders
 Show no mercy to the unrepentant enemies of Humanity
 Obey all honourable orders
 Preserve the weak from the horrors of war

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Seat of Power: None officially
Head of the Cult: None officially, though rumours persist of a
cult leader marked with ten crosses
Primary Orders: The Crosses, the Brotherhood, the Crooked
Fingers
Major Festivals: The Day of Folly
Popular Holy Books: The Riddles Ten, Midnight and the Black
Cat, The Great Joke
Common Holy Symbols: Crossed fingers, Cats, Magpies
According to myth, Ranald was once mortal, a gentle bandit
who robbed from the rich and gave to the poor This so charmed
Shallya that the goddess fell in love One fateful day, she found
Ranald dying, fatally touched by the plagues of the Fly Lord
Unable to accept this, she let Ranald drink from her holy chalice,
granting the rogue eternal life But it was all a trick — Ranald
had faked it all — and, laughing, the new god gleefully danced
into the heavens While generally portrayed as a dapper Human
wearing a perpetual smile, there is little consistency to the height,
weight, skin colour, or even gender of Ranald, though the god
is more commonly portrayed as male in the Empire More a
cheerful trickster than outright criminal, Ranald is said to have a
love of deflating pride with clever tricks and ruses
Worshippers
Ranald most commonly stands as a patron to thieves and rogues,
but the cult also attracts gamblers, liars, merchants, tricksters, and
the poor and downtrodden
The cult of Ranald is, by general perception, a disorganised rabble
of charlatans, thieves, and ne’er-do-wells However, it is more coordinated
than it appears, and split into three primary orders The
Crosses are the most accepted — a priesthood overseeing the
cult’s gambling-dens, typically using the proceeds to administer
to the poor The Brotherhood is less open, and is somewhat akin
to a secret society of merchants — they use business to bring the
pompous and greedy to their knees Lastly, and most widespread,
is the publicly disavowed Crooked Fingers, the thieves, rogues,
and liars of Ranald, a group that is roundly distrusted
Cultists of Ranald have no conventional garb to identify them,
but always work cross symbols into their clothing somewhere,
perhaps as a repeating pattern
Holy Sites
Ranald has no formal temple organisation, although the cult
maintains seemingly unconnected gambling dens in most towns
and cities Small shrines are found in the headquarters of many
criminal gangs and merchant houses, and the poorer quarters of
many cities have street-corner shrines dedicated to the God of
Luck The latter are often maintained by local ‘shrine clubs’ which
operate as both social and religious bodies, and are usually led by
one of the Crooked Fingers Shrines are almost never elaborate,
often just a simple, smiling statue with crossed fingers behind
the back, or a crudely depicted cat or magpie, often fashioned as
if smiling
Penances
Ranald’s penances usually involve stealing into locked and
guarded locations to recover precious items or leave a token of
their presence Humiliating oppressors of the poor is also common
— perhaps by framing a brutal Watch captain for a ludicrous
crime, for example, or locking him in his own cells Ranald often
sends favoured and disfavoured cultists alike on a ‘Pilgrimage of
Fingers’, a set of tasks proving capability and loyalty
Strictures
 One coin in ten belongs to Ranald
 Never betray another to the authorities; there is no
greater sin than informing
 Violence is prohibited except in self-defence
 It is better to live free and die than live under oppression
 There is no honour among thieves, but there is amongst
Ranaldans

208
Seat of Power: None officially
Head of the Cult: None
Primary Orders: None
Major Festivals: Summer Solstice, with equinoxes also
celebrated
Popular Holy Books: None, though many oral traditions exist
Common Holy Symbols: Sheaf of wheat, fruit, spirals
Bountiful Rhya is the Goddess of Fertility and Summer, widely
known as the Earth Mother and She Who Sustains Life
Though typically depicted as the wife of Taal, myths connect
her to many gods, and she has children from many of those
relationships Most commonly portrayed as a tall, beautiful
women wreathed in leaves and bedecked in fruit, Rhya’s statues
are normally nude, pregnant, and surrounded by her children
Many theologians tie Rhya to the Old Faith, a prehistoric cult
comprised of ancient farmers and hunters who wrested a living
from the land before the Empire was born, and one still found
in secluded communities to this day
Worshippers
Rural folk across the Old World venerate Rhya, relying on her
to provide the crops upon which their lives depends Womanfolk
comprise the main body of the cult, and most midwives pay
at least lip-service to Rhya’s Wisdom, a set of oral traditions
surrounding childbirth Although she is not openly worshipped
in the towns and cities — townsfolk often turning to Shallya in
her stead — her name is frequently tied with Taal’s, so she is still
well known amongst such people
Because the cult has no great temples and protects no holy books
or relics of significance, many scholars believe her worship to
be declining, and possibly already dead Her many cultists do
nothing to contradict such talk
Rhya’s cultists have no fixed vestment or preferred garb, though
greens are very common, as is using plants, flowers, or herbs to
accessorise any clothing They often dress in a fashion considered
far too revealing by Sigmarite doctrine, which can cause friction
as the Rhyans believe giving in to such prudishness is tantamount
to encouraging the Prince of Excess into your lives, as it builds
forbidden desires Devotees of Sigmar invariably disagree,
believing abstinence and restricting temptation is a better
response to such dangers than indulgence
Holy Sites
Rhya has no large temples, though many ancient sites constructed
from oghams (standing stones) are centres of worship for her
cult, and some still echo each equinox with the cries of fevered
celebrants
Shrines to Rhya are usually simple statues of the goddess, often
piled high with offerings of food and drink Older shrines are
often made of small standing stones marked with worn, spiralled
patterns
Penances
Rhyan penances may involve replanting devastated areas, helping
broken households, and maintaining sacred groves It is also
common to find Rhyans tasked to protect helpless families,
which can often put them at odds with local bailiffs and law
enforcement
Strictures
 Defend families, children, and crops from all harm
 Never feel shame for the flesh Rhya gave you
 Life is sacred, do no harm lest another life is in danger
 Never judge whom another loves
 Interrupt the work of the Prince of Excess wherever it
may thirst

Shallya is the Goddess of Healing, Mercy, and Compassion She
is the daughter of Verena and Morr, and the sister of Myrmidia
Shallya is normally portrayed as a young, beautiful maiden whose
eyes are perpetually welling with tears as she weeps for the
world’s pain It is said Shallya’s compassion knows no bounds,
and in some myths — such as the stories of Ranald tricking
her into granting him immortality, or Manaan trapping her
at the bottom of the sea — she seems trusting to the point of
foolishness However, her cultists maintain her mercy is available
to all, without judgment True foolishness consists of presuming
to judge who is worthy of Shallya’s grace and who is not
Worshippers
Most Old Worlders think of Shallya’s cult as composed of healers
and physicians, but her worshippers also include many who work
to help alleviate suffering of other kinds: charitable souls who
help the poor; workers in orphanages, asylums, and refuges; and
even brave folk who go in search of lost and missing people on
behalf of their loved ones The cult is ruled by the far-reaching
Order of the Bleeding Heart, which maintains all the temples,
hospices, mercyhouses, and other holy sites The significantly
smaller Order of the Chalice tasks its mendicants to cleanse
the Fly Lord’s influence, tackling the worst diseases and plagues
wherever they may fester
Shallya’s cultists all wear white robes, often hooded, with a
bleeding heart symbol embroidered on the left breast
Holy Sites
The high temple of all Shallya’s cult is in Couronne, Bretonnia,
built over a famous healing spring Locals claim the magical
waters were once poured there from the same chalice Shallya used
to grant Ranald immortality, which they claim is the holy grail of
the Lady, the patron Goddess of Bretonnia Whatever the truth, it
is a popular destination for pilgrims, many of whom travel there to
be healed from intractable disease Elsewhere, every town or city
of any size has a temple to Shallya, and most smaller settlements
have at least a shrine dedicated to her Temples of Shallya normally
consist of a courtyard with a temple on one side and an infirmary
on the other, all constructed in southern styles Larger temples have
smaller subsidiary chapels, commonly endowed by local families,
and are often connected to hospitals Shrines are usually simple,
often with the dove or heart of Shallya carved into stone, or with
small fountains gushing eternal tears from simple statues
Penances
Penances set by Shallya always involve helping the sick, poor,
or downtrodden A cultist might be sent to a village struck by a
plague to tend the sick until the disease has passed Shallya often
tasks her servants to help the wounded at war, or patrol popular
pilgrimage routes for those unable to complete their journeys due
to ill health
Strictures
 Always render assistance without judgement, based only
on a person’s need
 Never kill except in self-defence or when facing
followers of the Fly Lord
 Hunt down servants of the Fly Lord wherever they may
fester
 Shallya’s work is never done, so turn not to selfindulgence
 Never take up arms; a walking stick and courage will
suffice

Seat of Power: Altdorf, Reikland
Head of the Cult: The Grand Theogonist
Primary Orders: Order of the Anvil, Order of the Cleansing
Flame, Order of the Silver Hammer, Order of the Torch
Major Festivals: Sigmarday (28th Sigmarzeit)
Popular Holy Books: The Book of Sigmar, Deus Sigmar, The
Geistbuch
Common Holy Symbols: Ghal-maraz (Sigmar’s Warhammer),
twin-tailed comets, griffons
Sigmar is the Empire’s patron, and his cult dominates the realm
Because Sigmar was once the emperor, his worship is inextricably
interwoven with politics, and three of the cult’s highest-ranking
members are directly involved with electing new emperors
According to legend, 2,500 years ago Sigmar’s birth was heralded
by a twin-tailed comet, and he was born the first son of the chief
of the Unberogen tribe When older, he received the magical
warhammer Ghal-maraz (‘Skull-splitter’) as a gift from the Dwarf
king Kurgan Ironbeard for saving his life from Greenskins Sigmar
later allied with the Dwarfs and their combined forces defeated
the Greenskins He was then crowned as the first emperor of the
Human tribes he’d united After fifty years of extraordinary rule,
Sigmar mysteriously vanished, only to later ascend to divinity,
crowned as a god by Ulric, Sigmar’s patron in life
Worshippers
Most folk of the Empire pay at least lip-service to their patron
deity In the most devout provinces, like Reikland, Sigmar
worship is an unquestioned part of daily life Folk attend weekly
‘throngs’ where the lessons of Sigmar are preached Many also
attend temple to train as local militia, confess sins and purify
the soul, or receive advice on how to be more like the God-King
of old Sigmar’s cult is comprised of an uncounted number of
different orders The largest is the Order of the Torch: Sigmar’s
priests who lead their local communities Other orders of
importance include: the Order of the Cleansing Flame,
comprised of inquisitors and witch hunters; the Order of the
Silver Hammer, which includes warrior priests and yet more
witch hunters; and the Order of the Anvil, a monastic order
concerned with preserving Sigmar’s deeds and laws The cult
also has many templar orders The most famous are the proud
Knights of Sigmar’s Blood, the fanatical Knights of the Fiery
Heart, and the militaristic Knights Griffon Given the cult is so
large, there are many different uniforms, vestments, and robes
worn, all of which have different colours, cuts, and accessories
according to local tradition and requirement
Holy Sites
Every city, town, and village in the Empire has at least one temple
to Sigmar The Grand Cathedral in Altdorf is staffed by hundreds
of priests and lay workers, and guarded by at least two orders of
templars; at the other end of the scale, a village chapel may be
visited just once every week by a travelling priest, who serves the
needs of several small settlements Shrines can be found in most
homes, and wayshrines dot every major highway, mostly marked
with hammers or comets
Penances
Sigmarite cultists may be ordered to destroy a cell of Chaosworshippers,
or expose a corrupt official who is secretly in league
with the Ruinous Powers or a foreign power It is also common
to be tasked with building, or rebuilding, local communities to
better promote unity and strength in the Empire
Strictures
 Obey your orders
 Aid Dwarf-folk, never do them harm
 Promote the unity of the Empire
 Bear true allegiance to the imperial throne

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Seat of Power: Talabheim, Talabecland
Head of the Cult: The Hierarch
Primary Orders: Order of the Antler, The Longshanks
Major Festivals: Spring Equinox, with other equinoxes also
celebrated
Popular Holy Books: The Book of Green, Rites of the Ancient
Grove, Tome of Summer’s Path
Common Holy Symbols: Antlers, oaks, stone axes
Taal is the God of Wild Places and Animals, and the King
of Nature He is the husband to Rhya, and father to Manaan,
and is perceived by Taalites to be the king of the gods, though
other cults dispute this All nature is under his purview, from the
snaking rivers to the tallest mountains, from the smallest insect to
the greatest beast He is normally portrayed as a powerfully built,
virile man with long, wild hair and great spreading antlers, and is
known for his volatile moods and his need to hunt
Worshippers
Rural folk across the Old World venerate Taal, and any who
make their living in wild places take care not to offend him Taal
is the patron deity of Talabecland in the Empire, where his cult
holds significant sway, influencing all levels of society
Taal’s cult has a variety of smaller orders dedicated to holy sites
and groves throughout the Old World, but two orders drive the
cult forwards The Order of the Antler are the priests of the cult,
who are tasked to teach Taal’s ways and protect the wild places
from intrusion
These Taalites are particularly widespread in Talabecland,
and their forest temples are hubs of activity for rural folk The
Longshanks are a mix of warrior-priest and templar who typically
wander as individuals, cleansing Taal’s wild places of corruption
and ensuring rural communities do nothing to upset Father Taal
Holy Sites
Normally, temples to Taal are small, rustic affairs, built of wood
and rough stone in a manner unchanged for countless centuries
They are usually sited close to natural features of wonder such as
waterfalls, swirling pools, and mountains, and often have small
sweat lodges attached The high temple of Taal in Talabheim is
something of an anomaly when compared to this It appears more a
well-maintained, albeit wild, noble garden than a temple, and huge
services are held there under the spreading rowan trees weekly
Officially, the Hierarch leads the cult from there, though he spends
most of his time in the wild groves of the nearby Taalgrunhaar
Forest Shrines to Taal are barely structures at all Some old trees
are regarded as sacred, and offerings pile up at their bases Caves,
forest groves, and other natural places are also used as shrines, and
usually only a local or a devout follower of Taal can find them
Penances
Taal’s penances usually involve clearing diseased or mutated
monsters from wild areas, replanting sacred trees, and maintaining
groves important to the cult A cultist might also be ordered to
climb a high mountain and leave a stone on a cairn at the top,
or clear an obstruction at the top of a waterfall Whatever the
specific task that must be undertaken, Taal’s penances almost
always challenge the cultist to survive in the wild
Strictures
 Offer a prayer of thanks for every animal taken
 Spend a week alone communing with the wilderness
every year
 Eschew metal armour; clad yourself in the hides of Taal
 Rely on your own skill, not the advances of gunpowder
or cold technology
 Never harm an animal except in self-defence or for food
or sacrifice

Seat of Power: Middenheim, Middenland
Head of the Cult: Ar-Ulric
Primary Orders: Order of the Howling Wolf, Order of the
Knights of the White Wolf
Major Festivals: Campaign Start, Hochwinter, Campaign End
Popular Holy Books: Liber Lupus, Teutognengeschichte, The
Ulric Creed
Common Holy Symbols: White Wolves, stylised ‘U’s, claws
Ulric is the ferocious God of Wolves, Winter, and Warfare He is
the brother of Taal and, according to Ulrican lore, the king of the
gods, although other cults dispute this He is normally portrayed
as a massive, heavily bearded barbarian wearing a white wolfpelt
cloak, and bearing a mighty war-axe named Blitzbeil He’s
a distant, harsh, and unforgiving god who expects his cultists to
rely on individual strength and prowess He despises weakness,
cowardice, and trickery, and favours the direct approach in all
matters
Worshippers
Ulric’s cult is strongest in the north of the Empire The city-state
of Middenheim, with its enormous high temple to Ulric, is the
heart of his cult, and the god is regarded as the city’s patron
Elsewhere, he is worshipped mainly by warriors and soldiers
Devout Ulricans can usually be spotted by their long hair and
beards, for most choose not to cut it, imitating their wild deity
Ulric’s cult is split into just two orders: the priestly Howling
Wolves, and the templar White Wolves The Howling Wolves are
not very popular outside Middenland and Nordland, viewed by
most folk to be too coarse for this enlightened era By comparison,
the Knights of the White Wolf are enormously popular, easily the
largest knightly order in the Empire, and the oldest templar order
in the Old World Ulric’s priests wear black robes with a howling
white wolf emblem on the chest A wolf pelt across the shoulders
is also common, as is fur trimmings
Holy Sites
Ulric’s high temple is in Middenheim, and the cult’s leader, ArUlric
(which means the son of Ulric), has enormous temporal and
spiritual sway At the back of the high temple lies the Flame of
Ulric, a huge, ever-burning, argent fire granted by the winter god
to guide his people This miracle is the focus of several pilgrimage
routes, and all Ulricans of Middenland are expected to bathe in
its cold light at least once in their lives Smaller temples are found
in every city and town of any size, but are grander and more
numerous in the north than in the south Chapels and shrines
can be found in barracks and forts throughout the Old World
Temples resemble fortified keeps and are normally square The
interior of the main hall is lit by small windows high in the walls,
and by an ever-stocked fire in a circular hearth tended by the
priesthood Behind the fire, usually against a rear wall, stands a
statue of Ulric enthroned, often flanked by a pair of enormous
wolves Shrines are similar but smaller, with a lamp in place of a
fire and small statues just a foot or two tall
Penances
Penances set by Ulric are almost always tests of strength, courage,
and martial skill Slaying a powerful monster, or clearing out a
nest of Beastmen or outlaws, are typical tasks
Strictures
 Obey your betters
 Defend your honour in all matters, and never refuse a
challenge
 Stand honest and true; outside an ambush, trickery and
deception are forbidden
 Only wear pelts from wolves killed by weapons crafted
of your own hands
 Blackpowder, helmets, crossbows, and technology are
not Ulric’s way

Primary Orders: The Order of Scalebearers, the Order of
Lorekeepers, the Order of Mysteries, the Order of Everlasting
Light
Major Festivals: Year Blessing
Popular Holy Books: Canticum Verena, Eulogium Verena, The
Book of Swords
Common Holy Symbols: Scales of justice, owls, downwardpointing
swords
Wise Verena, the Goddess of Learning and Justice, is the wife
of dark Morr and the mother of Myrmidia and Shallya She
is generally depicted as a tall, classically beautiful woman, and
usually carries a sword and a set of scales As the patron of justice
she is concerned with fairness rather than the letter of the law:
she opposes tyranny and oppression as much as crime
Worshippers
Verena is worshipped throughout the Old World, especially in
the south Her devout followers include scholars, lawyers, and
magistrates, as well as some magisters of the Colleges of Magic,
particularly of the Grey and Light orders
The cult of Verena has no rigid hierarchy: it is said that Verena
alone heads the cult, and no mortal intermediary is needed
because truth is self-evident and requires no interpretation
Temple priests from the Order of Lorekeepers are tasked to
preserve knowledge and communicate it to the community
They keep up a voluminous correspondence with each other,
exchanging information and news
Priests from the equally influential Order of Scalebearers are
much sought after to act as judges, arbitrators, and go-betweens,
because of their famed impartiality and mastery of the law
The Order of Mysteries is much smaller and less well-known,
and contains warrior-priests who seek lost and forgotten lore,
wherever it may lie The last major order is the Knights of the
Everlasting Light, templars famed for their sword skills, sense
of fairness, and legendary bad luck Verena’s cultists usually wear
plain white robes, symbolic of pure truth and impartiality
Holy Sites
Temples to Verena can be found in most cities and larger
towns, generally situated in the administrative or university
quarters Most libraries and court-houses include a shrine to the
goddess, and smaller shrines can be found in the homes of many
scholars and lawyers Temples usually have colonnaded facades,
with symbols of the goddess and allegorical figures of learning
presented in low relief Inside is a large statue of Verena, normally
seated with a book in her lap, a pair of scales in her left hand, and
her right hand resting on the hilt of a sword Smaller rooms lead
off from the main temple, including a library and chambers for
the attendant priests Each temple has at least one meeting room
where negotiations can take place under the eyes of the goddess
Penances
Penances set by Verena normally involve the recovery or
preservation of knowledge, the righting of an injustice, or the
resolution of a dispute Cultists may also be sent to recover a longforgotten
book of lore, or to mediate in a difficult quarrel This
could be anything from a farmers’ boundary dispute to unpicking
the complicated politics of two realms on the brink of war
Strictures
 Never refuse to arbitrate a dispute when asked
 Always tell the truth without fear or favour
 Protect knowledge at all costs
 Combat must be a last resort when all alternative routes
are fruitless
 Never become a tool of injustice or heresy

The Cult of Verena, Goddess of Wisdom
214
Dwarven Ancestor Gods
The Dwarfs venerate their ancient ancestors, valuing tradition
above all else Though the Time of the Ancestor Gods was many
thousands of years ago, the Dwarfs still hold records of that time
in their oldest Holds Many names echo from that era, creating
a broad, inter-related pantheon, but three Ancestor Gods are
of especial importance and are known by all Dwarfs: Grimnir,
Grungni, and Valaya, each a progenitor of the species as a whole
In addition to the oldest Ancestor Gods, Dwarfs also revere the
founders of local clans as guardian deities
Dwarf Priests
Those dedicating themselves to the cults of the Ancestor Gods do
not use the Priest, Nun, or Warrior Priest Careers, as Dwarfs have
a very different relationship with their gods, seeking to emulate
them rather than worship or appease them
Because of this, if you wish to play a Dwarf dedicated to one of
the Ancestor Gods, simply choose an appropriate career to best
act like that god So, if you wanted to emulate Grimnir, effectively
becoming a priest of Grimnir, perhaps play a Slayer and join the
Cult of the Slayer, or maybe become a Soldier
Elven Gods
The Elves worshipped their own gods long before Humans and
most other species existed in their current forms Their pantheon
is extensive, with different groups of deities being held as
important by Wood Elves and High Elves
Loosely, there are two groups of gods, the Cadai and the Cytharai
The Cadai rule the heavens, and have strong connections to
their Elven worshippers, directly helping where they can The
selfish Cytharai rule the underworld, and care little for the
Elves Standing apart from both these courts are a loose group
of unaligned gods, the most prominent being Morai-Heg the
Crone, Goddess of Fate and Death
The High Elves especially revere the Cadai, and have sophisticated
priesthoods dedicated to their teachings They appease the
Cytharai when necessary, but it is unlawful to worship any but
Mathlann, whose aid is sought by mariners According to their
myths, Asuryan, the God of Creation, is king of all the gods, able
to pronounce judgement upon them all
The Wood Elves take a much more balanced approach and have
temples and shrines to all the gods impacting their lives, be they
Cadai or Cytharai Because of their close association with the
woods and forests, they revere Isha the Mother and Kurnous the
Hunter above all others, and rumours persist that both gods take
a direct hand in Wood Elf affairs
According to some theologians — mostly Elven — the deities of
this pantheon are the true gods, and those worshipped by other
species are simply different aspects of the Elven originals
Elven Priests
Both High Elves and Wood Elves have priesthoods for the gods,
but they do not have blessings and miracles The Elves don’t
believe the gods manifest in this fashion, and instead see magic
as a gift from the gods Because of this, if you wish to be an Elven
priest, use the Wizard career, and chose from an appropriate Lore
to represent the magic your god has gifted So, a ‘priest’ of Kurnous
would use the Lore of Beasts, a worshipper of Isha, the Lore of
Life, and devotees of Asuryan use the Lores of Light or Fire
Halfling Gods
Some say that Halflings are superstitious rather than religious,
and the bulk of their deities support this impression Most
Halfling gods and goddesses have to do with hearth and home,
cooking, herb lore, earthy matters, and general day-to-day
concerns Halfling gods are practical rather than philosophical:
as the saying goes: ‘Deep thoughts butter no parsnips’ Halflings
also show respect to certain Human deities — Sigmar, Taal, and
Rhya in particular — but this is more from a desire to avoid
conflict than from any sincere devotion
Halfling Priests
Halflings don’t really have priests, and they certainly don’t build
temples (though Humans seem happy to do it for them, especially
Sigmarites) There are better things to do than warble on about
someone else’s business Of course, they respect the gods, and
have shrines on-hand should they need to have a quick natter,
but none make a career exclusively talking to just one god — why
make yourself so exclusive? Should a particular god need to be
appeased, it is usually left up to a local elder to do what’s required
on behalf of the community, often after a great deal of talking
with relevant experts and peers

Chaos Gods
The Ruinous Powers of Chaos are the foremost existential
threat to the Old World, but much about them remains a
mystery Merely seeking such knowledge is punishable by death
without permission from the Cult of Sigmar And seeking such
permission attracts intense scrutiny of your person and motives,
and is seldom granted
The Ruinous Powers are seen by the common folk as the punishing
manifestation of sin, and the reason that all must behave within
socially acceptable boundaries as espoused by the cults Indulging
in violence, lust, slovenliness or unseemly curiosity has direct
repercussions for the individual (as they are corrupted and come to
a sticky end) and for their community, as their deviant behaviour
attracts the destructive attention of these evil forces
The average person will know of the most powerful of these
forces through euphemistic names, such as the Blood God, the
Plague Lord, the Lord of Change, and the Prince of Pain Even
the most learned scholars of this forbidden lore can only guess
at what motivates these obscene powers, or if they even have an
agenda beyond their primal impulses
It seems there are competing factions dedicated to different
aspects of ruin, and they are as much enemies to each other as
to the rest of the Old World On the rare occasions when they
co-operate, much like they did during the Great War Against
Chaos over two-hundred years ago, the world trembles Some
claim cults dedicated to the Chaos Gods have infiltrated the
Empire Most dismiss this as nonsense, for no right-thinking
individual would be so foolish as to worship one of the Ruinous
Powers
Prayers
A small number of the faithful stand apart from their peers,
seemingly able to appeal for their deity’s direct intervention in
the form of miracles Those who perform such feats are known
by many names in different parts of the Old World — including:
Living Saints, Gods’ Servants, The Hallowed, Divine Wills,
Anointed Ones — but, in the Empire, they are most commonly
referred to as ‘Blessed’, which is often used as a title So, if Sister
Anna where to be Blessed by Sigmar — ie granted Sigmar’s
grace, able to have her prayers answered — she would become
‘Blessed Anna’, or, in full, ‘Blessed Anna, Sister of Sigmar’
The Blessed
There are two Talents that specifically mark out those Blessed
by the gods: Bless and Invoke Characters with the Bless Talent
may enact Blessings, which are minor manifestations of divine
will, while the Invoke Talent allows the Blessed to call on their
gods for more powerful Miracles For more on these Talents, see
Chapter 4: Skills and Talents
Blessings and Miracles
Blessing and Miracles are prayers spoken by one of the Blessed,
and then empowered by a god To enact a Blessing or Miracle,
make a Challenging (+0) Pray Test If you score a Success, your
Blessing or Miracle manifests according to its rules, and a high
SL will give you bonus effects If you score a Failure, your words
are spoken, but your god, for whatever reason, refuses to listen If
you Fumble the Pray Test, you have offended your god and must
roll on the Wrath of the Gods table
Limitations
You must be able to speak to intone the required prayer, rite,
chant, or song to enact a Blessing or Miracle Each of your
Blessings or Miracles can only be in effect once, meaning you
have to wait for an existing one to come to an end before using
the same prayer again
Multiple invocations of the same prayer by different individuals
do not offer cumulative bonuses Thus, intoning two Blessings of
Finesse will only provide a bonus of +10 to Dexterity
Sin Points
The Blessed are watched closely by the gods, and risk gaining the
disfavour of their deities if they should act contrary to their gods’
will In game, this is represented with Sin points
If you violate any of the Cult Strictures listed under your god,
the GM will award one or more Sin Points Every time you
receive a Sin point, it is added it to your running total There is
no maximum to the number of Sin points you can earn The more
points you have, the more upset your god is likely to be should
you call upon divine aid
It’s a Sin!
There are many different ways Blessed Priests can break their
strictures; GMs should consider the scale of the infraction
when awarding Sin Points, and allocate them proportionately,
normally scoring 1 to 3 For instance, one of the strictures
of the cult of Myrmidia is to respect prisoners of war If a
Myrmidian priest were to deny a thirsty prisoner of war a
drink of water, this may earn a single Sin point Beating a
prisoner would be a great infraction, securing maybe 2 Sin
points Torturing or killing a helpless prisoner is unacceptable
to Myrmidia, easily earning 3 or maybe more Sin points
Kind GMs may wish to warn players before they commit
infractions, especially if they are new to WFRP

Sin and Wrath
Appealing to your deity when you have been acting contrary to
the god’s wishes is risky Whenever you make a Pray Test, if the
units die of the result is equal to or less than your current Sin
point total, then you will suffer the Wrath of the Gods, even if
the Pray Test is successful
Options: Preach It, Sister!
Each of the gods have different styles of prayers, designed to
be intoned in different ways Whether these are the warcries
of Ulric, the shanties of Manaan, or the threnodies of Morr,
each requires the words be spoken (or sung) firmly, and with
conviction
To represent this, the GM may require that any Pray Tests
that are intoned quietly or without confidence have a higher
Difficulty
Wrath of the Gods
The Wrath of Gods table is referenced whenever you Fumble a
Pray Test, or when the units die of a Pray Test is equal or lower
than your current Sin points The GM may also use it, or pluck
results from it, whenever you foolishly insult any of the gods
When rolling on the Wrath of the Gods table, add +10 to the roll
for each Sin Point you have accrued After rolling and applying
the result, reduce your Sin points by 1, to a minimum of 0
You’ve Got To Pray!
If a character behaves in a particularly pious manner, such as
completing an arduous pilgrimage, or making a significant
donation to their cult, the GM may wish to remove one or
more Sin Points with a successful Pray Test, used to show you
are begging for absolution This, of course, also risks the chance
of Wrath of the Gods Otherwise, the only way to remove Sin
Points is by rolling on the Wrath of the Gods table

Divine Servants
Divine servants are supernatural minions of the gods in the
material realm, in the same way that Daemons serve the Dark
Gods They tend to take the form either of a favoured animal —
such as a white wolf for Ulric or a golden eagle for Myrmidia
— or a departed devotee of the god, such as a legendary priest or
templar To construct Divine Servants appropriate to the god at
hand, use the rules in Chapter 12: Bestiary, modifying an animal,
Human, or Daemon as you see fit
Penance
Some Wrath of the Gods results require penance The GM can
decide upon a suitable penance depending on your misdeed, or
they may prefer you to choose your own penance, with further
punishment awaiting if you are insufficiently penitent Examples
of typical penances are listed in each cult description Penances
may come in the form of a vision, divine inspiration or, very rarely,
by direct communication from your deity If you are not worthy
of such contact, a penance may be conveyed through another
member of your cult Alternatively, a Divine Servant of the cult
could manifest — this could be a dead teacher, a figure of legend,
or an appropriate animal — and inform you what is required
The GM should consider the sins involved, and how the god in
question would likely react to these
Blessings
Blessings are minor manifestations of divine will; a character
with the Bless Talent receives all six Blessings for their cult as
listed in Blessings by Cult
Blessing and Mi racle Format
 The Name of the Blessing or Miracle
	 Range: A range in yards, or marked as ‘touch’, showing
you need touch your target
	 Target: The number of targets affected; it may just be
you
	 Duration: The duration of the Blessing, usually
expressed as ‘Instant’ or as a number of Rounds
 The description of what the Blessing does
Options: Petty Concerns
The gods grow irritated when the Blessed abuse their privileges
If the GM wishes, multiple uses of Blessings and Miracles
in the same scene, on the same injury, on the same target, or
similar can anger the gods, and result in Sin Points, typically
ranging from 1 to 3
Success Levels
For every +2 SL you score in a Pray Test when attempting a
Blessing, you may choose one of the following benefits:
	 Range: +6 yards
	 Targets: +1
	 Duration: +6 Rounds
If the Blessing in question has a Duration of ‘Instant’, you may
not extend the Duration You may choose the same option more
than once For instance, if you rolled +4 SL on a Blessing of
Healing, you could heal three targets you were touching, two
targets up to 6 yards away, or one target up to 12 yards away

Divine Manifestations
Blessings are subtle, completely imperceptible to those without the Holy Visions Talent, their manifestation usually indistinguishable
to good fortune In this way, Clerics of the Old World without the Blessing Talent often appear to be as effective as those with it
By comparison, Miracles are overtly manifest, always accompanied by holy signs and portents, which should reflect the circumstances
and relevant deity For instance, an Ulrican Miracle may be accompanied by a chill wind and the spectral howl of wolves, while those
receiving a Miracle of Manann may find themselves drenched in saltwater
221
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Names
Each Cult has unique names for every Blessing and Miracle
— sometimes more than one name For instance, the Cult of
Sigmar may refer to the Blessing of Battle as ‘The Litany of
Sigmar’s Wrath’, while the Cult of Ulric may call it ‘The
Sharp Bite of Winter’ The words spoken will be different, but
the end effect will be the same
Miracles
Miracles are major manifestations of a god’s will, awe-inspiring
events everyone will notice; a character with the Invoke Talent
can empower one of the Miracles for their cult from the following
lists
Success Levels
For every 2 Success Levels you achieve in a Miracle Pray test, you
may add additional range, duration or targets equal to the initial
value listed in the Miracle So, a Miracle with a range of 50 yards
could be increased by an extra +50 yards for every +2 SL scored
Miracles with a Range and Target of ‘You’ may only target the
Blessed Priest making the Pray Test, and can never have the range
or targets increased Similarly, if the Miracle has no duration, there
is no benefit in choosing to extend its duration
Certain Miracles may have additional, optional, benefits for
additional SL written into their descriptions

 Magi c 
‘Keep your cannons, you Nulner idiot! We don’t need them’
– Thyrus Gorman, Patriarch of the Bright Order
Magical abilities mark you as a figure of terror and awe in the
Empire Prior to the establishment of the Colleges of Magic
in Altdorf, those able to wield magic were reviled outlaws
Nowadays being a witch is not illegal, but casting magic without
a licence is Spellcasters within the Empire must either study at
the Colleges of Magic, refrain from casting spells, or hope no-one
notices their illicit activity Even licenced Magisters are generally
feared and avoided — legal status has done nothing to reduce the
superstitious dread of the common folk
Magic is seen as unnatural and is notorious for its darker
elements: the crippling hexes of witchcraft, the raising of the
dead, and the summoning of Daemonic entities Even when
practiced according to the teaching of the Colleges, magic can
be the cause of trouble The very source of magic is unstable, and
even the most experienced spellcaster can lose focus, resulting in
dangerous accidents and unexpected side-effects
The Aethyr
Scholars of magic derive their learning from the Elves, who
explained the source of all magical power is the Aethyr This
infinite dimension, said to be the spawning ground of daemons
and spirits, exists beyond the physical world The Elves taught
that far to the north of the Empire, a great ragged wound was
torn through the fabric of the world to the Aethyr, and it bleeds
raw magic These roiling energies — known as the Winds of
Magic — blow throughout the world, gathering and eddying in
great heavenly whorls, only to rain down and permeate the land
and the creatures dwelling upon it It is these powerful winds that
wizards and witches use to fuel their spells
The Winds of Magic
As magical power bursts into the mortal realm and sweeps
down from the north, it splinters and separates, like light splitting
through a prism The Colleges of Magic state this creates eight
discrete Winds referred to by colour, each with its own character
and strengths The Elves support this, teaching the same eight
winds to their apprentices before moving on to more powerful
magics
Only a small minority of Humans can perceive the Winds, and
even fewer can bend them to their will Most Elves are sensitive
to them, and many possess the ability to see the Winds clearly
— commonly known as Second Sight, or just the Sight — with
many also able to learn how to cast magic Dwarfs disdain magic,
perhaps because they are partially immune to it, and no Dwarf
wizards are known Halflings are largely indifferent towards magic:
except when it delivers impressive or entertaining spectacles
The Elves directed (as a condition of their tuition) that Human
spellcasters should each only use a single Wind of Magic They
What is the Aethyr?
There is much heated debate between ‘experts’ on the nature of magic The lecture halls of the Empire’s most learned institutions
often see ambitious scholars expound on their latest theories Some liken magic to the backstage of a theatre, a mass of mechanisms,
props, and hidden pulleys responsible for the drama viewed by the audience Others resort to mathematical metaphors, complete with
incomprehensible esoteric diagrams Although such may end with an air of confident finality, it will only be met with polite coughs,
raised hands, and a litany of objections and exceptions
magi c VIII
229
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
argued that while it is possible to cast spells by drawing from
multiple winds, doing so is a risky proposition for the feeble,
corruptible Human mind This wisdom has been adopted by the
Colleges, and each specialises in a single colour
Some witches outside the College system consider these
restrictions ludicrous, an attempt by the Elves to keep the most
powerful magics to themselves Drawing on multiple winds is a
quick route to power, but also to damnation Many an unlicensed
witch has proved unable to resist this temptation, a practice usually
called Dark Magic, only to be brought low by Witch Hunters
Others believe magical energies are not so easily categorised
Many different types of ‘wizard’ and ‘witch’ can be found
throughout the Old World, with some practicing magic that
seems to lie outside colour magic, such as the cold-hearted Ice
Witches of Kislev, or the shamans and sorcerers found amongst
some of the other species besetting the Empire, such as the
Greenskins
The Language of Magick
The Winds of Magic may blow through all things incessantly, but
they are relatively harmless until harnessed by the Language of
Magick For reasons not fully understood, when certain sounds
are uttered by those attuned to magic, the Winds answer The
Colleges of Magic teach a complex language called the lingua
praestantia which form the basis of their spells, originally taught
to Humanity by the Elves Although extraordinarily difficult
to correctly annunciate, it is a significant simplification of the
Elven tongue Anoqeyån, the language used by the Elves to shape
their own, more powerful magics Magisters of the Colleges and
the Elves are not alone in their knowledge of the Language of
Magick Its complex forms are also spoken by many magical
creatures found across the Old World, including Spirits and
Daemons Many witches seem to instinctively understand the
language, almost as if it somehow wormed inside them, begging
to be spoken as a spell
The Eight Lores
Each of the eight Winds of Magic has an associated Lore, a
body of spells and knowledge its adepts use Each of the eight
Colleges of Magic is dedicated to the study of a single Lore, and
their buildings are constructed to focus their Wind to facilitate
relatively safe tuition
The Lore of Light
The Lore of Light relates to Hysh, the white wind
Hysh is considered the most difficult Wind to
perceive and manipulate, appearing diffuse even to
those skilled with the Sight This makes it tricky to manipulate
but less unpredictable than other Winds Hysh is associated with
patience, intelligence, and purity The Hierophants of the Light
Order are acclaimed for their discipline, knowledge, and devoted
opposition to Chaos
Spells from the Lore of Light are some of the most powerful,
including piercing rays of blinding light, and those that banish
Daemons and Undead creatures from the mortal plane There are
also more gentle applications of Hysh used to heal comrades or
clarify thought
The Lore of Metal
The Lore of Metal relates to Chamon, the gold
wind Chamon appears dense and heavy to Second
Sight, sinking into the earth and coalescing within
dense metals such as lead and gold The Alchemists of the Gold
Order have a reputation for being unusually prosaic in their
attitudes for wizards, and many are as interested in learning the
facts of physics and chemistry as they are in the working of magic
VIII
230
Spells from the Lore of Metal often involve the transmutation
or alteration of metal On the battlefield, alchemists have been
known to cause fine steel armour and weaponry to corrode or
melt, to weigh their foes down with suddenly dense armour, or to
enchant their allies’ weaponry with uncanny power
The Lore of Life
The Lore of Life relates to Ghyran, the jade wind
Free flowing Ghyran is associated with growth,
fertility and nourishment To those with The Sight,
Ghyran appears much like a light rain, falling to the ground and
pooling in eddying swirls It sinks into the soil and is drawn up
into the roots of plants from where it goes on to nourish all living
things The Druids of the Jade Order often prefer life away from
the cities, attuned to the seasons and the natural world
Spells from the Lore of Life commonly involve healing and
rejuvenation, from healing wounds to causing a barren field to
burst with life They can have offensive applications, too The
enemies of a Druid may find themselves suddenly tangled up in
wickedly sharp brambles and vines
The Lore of Heavens
The Lore of Heavens relates to Azyr, the blue
wind It cascades through the skies over the Old
World, crackling through the heavens, like a great
charged cloud Astromancers of the Celestial Order, known for
their calm and contemplative manners, use the wind to scry the
future, the lens of Azyr influencing what they can see in the stars
Spells from the Lore of Heavens involve the manipulation of fate,
throwing up protective barriers, or cursing a foe with an unnatural
run of bad luck On the battlefield, Astromancers also control
elemental forces, blasting their enemies with bolts of lightning, or
even drawing down shooting stars from the heavens
The Lore of Shadows
The Lore of Shadows relates to Ulgu, the grey
wind To the Sight it appears a thick fog, gathering
in pools wherever intrigue and deceit are practiced,
rising into great storms and tempests when conflict breaks out
Magisters of the Grey Order, known as Grey Guardians, are
secretive in their ways and given to uncertain loyalties Despite
this, the Grey Order is renowned for its wisdom and skill in
negotiations, and is often called upon for diplomatic missions
magi c VIII
231
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Spells from the Lore of Shadows can be used to mask or
obfuscate, confusing and disorienting their foes In battle, the
shadowy, insubstantial tendrils of Ulgu they wield can pierce
to the heart of their foes, eviscerating the most well-protected
troops, yet leaving armour eerily intact
The Lore of Death
The Lore of Death relates to Shyish, the purple
wind It is attracted to places of death, such
as battlefields, Gardens of Morr, and sites of
execution The wind is said to blow strongest during times of
transition, so wizards of the Amethyst Order tend to work their
greatest rites during the twilight before dawn, or during sunset
While Shyish is related to time and mortality, it is distinct from
Necromancy, the illegal practice of raising and binding the dead,
which uses the dark magic of Dhar in lieu of Shyish Indeed, the
Amethyst Order, much like the Cult of Morr, works tirelessly to
combat the threat of Necromancy
Nevertheless, spells from the Lore of Death resemble Necromancy
to the untrained eye They can drain their targets of life force,
spread fear among their enemies, and contact the spirits of the
departed
The Lore of Fire
The Lore of Fire relates to Aqshy, the red wind
Aqshy is a hot and searing wind associated with
brashness, courage, and zeal and is drawn to empirical
heat The Pyromancers of the Bright Order are bold and hottempered
and make for impressively destructive Battle Magisters
Many of the spells from the Lore of Fire are offensive in nature,
enabling the caster to conjure up great balls of fire, or cause the
blades of their allies to burst into flame Even their non-offensive
spells, such as crude healing magics, are still destructive in nature
Bright wizards are also adept at inspiring their allies, rallying
their courage and inspiring bravery and loyalty in the troops with
which they serve
The Lore of Beasts
The Lore of Beasts relates to Ghur, the amber
wind, a cold, primal force associated with the
savage wilds and the beasts living there To those
with the Sight Ghur seems to blow weakly in areas where the
wilderness has been tamed and settlements constructed This may
explain why the Shamans of the Amber Order often take up a
hermitic existence and shun their fellow men
The spells of the Lore of Beasts allow a Shaman to communicate
with animals, request their aid, and even summon them to battle
Shapeshifting magic may also be used by the wizard to adopt
animal forms
VIII
232
Elven Magic
Elves are long lived beings whose minds are more attuned to the
workings of magic than those of humanity High Elven mages
usually train in several, sometimes all, of the eight winds as part
of their apprenticeships, before the most promising move on
to study High Magic: Qhaysh This is the blending of multiple
winds of magic together into a blinding, coruscating energy This
magic is impressive and difficult, and Elves claim it is beyond the
capacity of humankind
The Wood Elves, too, make use of the eight Winds of Magic,
though their Spellsingers usually focus upon the Jade and Amber
Winds The most powerful usually go on to study either High
Magic like High Elves, or dread Dark Magic – a foul mixing of
the eight winds that can create tremendously destructive effects
Dark Magic
While difficult to master Qhaysh is the safe blending of multiple
Winds of Magic, Dhar, known commonly as Dark Magic, is
much more dangerous method of casting spells using multiple
winds It is usually only practiced by evil sorcerers, Necromancers,
and powerful witches, offering them a seductive source of raw
power, yet one laced with terrible side-effects Few can channel
Dhar for long, without succumbing to the corrupting influence of
the malevolent wind, their bodies and minds being warped into
unnatural states
Dhar resembles a stagnant mire to those with the Sight, pooling
in places saturated with evil, or corruption: the herdstones of
Beastmen, the dark idols of chaos cultists, and places where great
workings of several of the Winds of Magic took place Dhar is so
dense and potent that it can independently coalesce or crystalize
into physical matter, eventually forming the widely feared
substance called warpstone
Warpstone
Warpstone is a lump of pure magic in the material plane Its
unnatural provenance is immediately obvious to all who see it, as
it hurts the eyes and mutates anything drawing close for too long
Although its form varies, it often holds hard facets like flint, and
radiates a queasy green glow
Close examination of the substance is not to be undertaken
lightly Warpstone is the stuff of Chaos made manifest and its
presence is deeply corrupting Those who have direct contact
with warpstone risk illness, madness and mutation, and anyone
who ingests so much as a pinch of the stuff dooms themselves to
catastrophic warping of body and mind Nonetheless, the world
is full of reckless, ambitious fools who know that the volatile and
dangerous substance is a tremendous source of energy for spells
and rituals
The followers of Chaos and the Skaven do not hesitate to use it
To them, warpstone is a literal gift from the gods to be valued
above gold and jewels, and to be used against their enemies
Other Lores
In less frequented corners of the Empire, in villages and rural
communities far from the influence of the Colleges of Magic,
older forms of magic are still practiced even though they are
outlawed and punishable by death There are uncounted varieties
of these, but two of the more common Lores still practised by
Humans are Hedgecraft and Witchcraft
The Lore of Hedgecraft
Practitioners of Hedgecraft generally live quiet lives on the fringes
of smaller human settlements, in service to local communities
Just as they live their lives in the ‘hedge’ between civilisation and
the wilds of nature, so much of their magic concerns itself with
the liminal space between the material world and the realm of
the spirits Their magic tends to focus on folklore, spirits and
the natural world, as well as means to aid the rural communities
which shelter them Once a relatively common sight in the
Empire, over two centuries of persecution since the founding of
the Colleges of Magic has all but wiped them out
The Lore of Witchcraft
While the Lore of Witchcraft is not inherently malicious, or tied
to the gods of Chaos, it has a justly earned reputation for evil and
unpleasantness Often self-taught and using multiple Winds of
Magic, those practising the Lore of Witchcraft lack the discipline
or knowledge of College Magisters and are at a significant risk of
corruption The combination of the corrosive effects of Dhar and
being shunned by right-minded folk of the Empire often makes
these Witches bitter, spiteful souls, their hearts hard and flinty,
their gaze baleful and ill-omened
Magic Rules
Second Sight
The Second Sight Talent (see page 144) allows you to perceive
the Winds of Magic, and how magic influences the world around
you Second Sight affects all your senses, and how it manifests
is dependent on individual experience and training: So, where
Aqshy may have a hot, cinnamon odour to one pyromancer, it
could feel like searing ear itches to another
If you have Second Sight, you may use any appropriate Skills with
your aethyric senses, most commonly your Intuition, Perception,
and Track Skills For example, a Magister following the trail of a
fleeing witch could make a Track test, following the faint traces
of Dhar in the witch’s path, rather than their literal footsteps Or
a Witch looking to see what kind of magic had gathered locally
could use Perception to examine the Winds more closely Like the
mundane senses, Second Sight does not simply switch off, which
is a source of great discomfort to those who would rather have
no truck with the Winds of Magic but cannot help what they
perceive This means the GM may request Tests, or take Tests
on your behalf, to see if you spot subtle magical details in your
surrounding environment, even if you’re not looking for them
magi c VIII
233
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Spells
There are four types of spell: Petty, Arcane, Lore, and Chaos
spells Petty spells are simple tricks that use negligible amounts
of magic Arcane Spells are generic spells open to those studying
any Lore of Magic or Chaos Magic Lore spells are those you
can only learn if you know that Lore; ie to learn spells from the
Lore of Fire, you need the Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent Chaos
spells are those practiced by those who’ve lost their souls to
Chaos
Memorising Spells
Holding the complex linguistic structures of Language (Magick)
in mind is a challenging task, so simply transcribing a spell into
your grimoire does not allow you learn a spell
To memorise a spell — and therefore be able to cast it without
access to your grimoire — you typically need to spend the amount
of XP noted in your spellcasting Talent (see Chapter 4: Skills
and Talents) Once a spell has been memorised, a spellcaster
knows it permanently, barring special circumstances
Casting Test
To cast a spell, make a Language (Magick) Test If you succeed,
match your SL to the Casting Number (CN) of the spell (listed in
the individual spell description) If your SL is equal to or higher than
the CN of the spell, it is cast as explained in the spell’s description
If failed, the spell attempt fails, and nothing else happens
Critical Casting
If the casting roll is a Critical (see page 159), the Winds of Magic
have flared dangerously high, granting you extra power, but at
a cost Unless you have the Instinctive Diction Talent, you roll
on the Minor Miscast Table as the power moves beyond your
control, but you may also choose one of the following effects:
	 Critical Cast: If the spell causes Damage, it also inflicts a
Critical Wound See page 172 for details
	 Total Power: The spell is cast, no matter its CN and your
rolled SL, but can be Dispelled
	 Unstoppable Force: If you scored enough SL to cast your
spell, it cannot be Dispelled
Minor Miscast Table

Fumbled Casting
If you lose control of the magical energy you are channelling,
things invariably go awry If you Fumble your Casting Test, you
suffer a Miscast Roll 1d100 and consult the Minor Miscast Table
Malignant Influences
Casting close to sources of Corruption makes controlling
the Winds of Magic much more difficult When attempting
a Language (Magick) or Channelling Test in the vicinity of
a Corrupting Influence (see page 182), any roll of an 8
(representing the eight-pointed symbol of Chaos) on the units
die results in a Minor Miscast as the Magic goes wild If you
already have a Minor Miscast on the Test for another reason,
the Miscast escalates to a Major Miscast
Duration
If a spell is successfully cast, it remains in effect for its Duration
unless it is dispelled You may not simply end your spells already
in play, but you may attempt to Dispel them
Grimoires
Some spellcasters own a spellbook, or grimoire, in which they
transcribe their spells Apprentices copy spells from their master,
while experienced Magisters will actively seek out new spells from
other Magisters, often trading spells for favours A spellcaster
may cast a spell directly from a grimoire if the spell belongs to a
Lore they possess Doing so doubles the Casting Number
Magic Missiles
Some spells are marked as magic missiles; these are damagecausing
spells that all follow the same rules When a magic
missile is successfully cast and targets another character, the Hit
Location struck is determined by reversing the dice rolled on
the Language (Magick) Test and referring to the Hit Location
Table (see page 159) The SL of the Language (Magick) Test is
added to the spell’s listed Damage and your Willpower Bonus to
determine the total inflicted Damage This Damage is reduced by
the target’s Toughness and Armour Points as normal
Touch Spells in Combat
Certain spells require you to touch the target If in combat,
or if the target is unwilling to be touched, you must make an
Opposed Melee (Brawling) Test (generally opposed by the
Melee or Dodge Skill) after completing the Casting Test
If you do this and your spell was a magic missile, the Melee
(Brawling) Test is used to determine Hit Location struck, not
the Language (Magick) Test
Ingredients
Spellcasters may channel their magic through an appropriate
ingredient before unleashing their spells Doing this offers
protection against Miscasts as the attuned ingredient absorbs the
worst of any magical backlash
If you use an ingredient when casting, any suffered Major
Miscast becomes a Minor Miscast, and any Minor Miscast
has no effect If used in this way, the ingredient is consumed or
destroyed by the process, even if no Miscast was rolled
Ingredients cost the CN in silver shillings for Arcane and Lore
spells Whenever you purchase a new ingredient, mark on your
character sheet which spell it supports; ingredients only work for
specific spells, not for all spells in your Lore For those looking
to add character to their ingredients, sample ingredients for each
of the primary Lores of Magic are provided by the individual
spell lists
Limitations
As spells are spoken, you must be able to speak — not gagged,
strangled, or underwater — to cast If your voice is inhibited, the
Difficulty of your Language (Magick) Test to cast a spell should
be increased by the GM Further, the Language of Magick needs
to be spoken (or sung, for those using the Lore of Light) clearly,
and often loudly, to ensure spells work; magic is anything but
subtle As a loose guide, the higher the CN of a spell, the louder
the spell is chanted
Each of your spells can only be in effect once, meaning you have
to wait for a cast spell to come to an end, or be dispelled, before
using the same spell again Further, spells providing bonuses or
penalties do not stack Instead, the best bonus and worst penalty
is applied from every spell cast upon you So, if you had a spell
providing a bonus of +20 Willpower, and another providing +10
Willpower, you gain a bonus of +20 Willpower, not +30
Lastly, unless otherwise specified, you always need to be able to
see — ie have Line of Sight — to your target
Advantage and Magic
Advantage in combat applies to Casting Tests, not Channelling
Tests When casting magic, you can also gain Advantage in
the following way: If the target has already had a spell from
the same Lore cast upon it in that Round, gain +1 Advantage
as you cast, as the upswelling of your Wind aids channelling
magic See page 164 for Advantage rules
VIII
236
Channelling Test
Some magical spells require far more magic than can normally
be found ambiently flowing through the world To power such
spells, it is possible to draw the Winds of Magic and concentrate
them into a more powerful form by using the Channelling Skill
Channelling the Winds of Magic can be a dangerous procedure,
but it is the only sure way to cast some powerful spells To channel
magic for a spell, make an Extended Channelling Test
When your SL reaches the CN of your selected spell, you have
channelled enough magic to cast it On the next Round, you can
cast your spell using the normal Casting rules, but count the
chosen spell’s Casting Number as 0 If the casting Test fails, you
also lose all your channelled magical energy, and suffer a Minor
Miscast as it all writhes free from your Aethyric grasp
Critical Channelling
If you roll a Critical when Channelling, you have channelled
a mighty flow of magic and can cast your spell next Round
regardless of the SL you’ve scored in the Extended Test so far;
however, so much magic so quickly concentrated in one place
results in some magical backlash: roll 1d100 on the Minor
Miscast Table unless you have the Aethyric Attunement Talent
(see page 132)
Fumble
Channelling the Winds of Magic in a large flow is dangerous
You count any double or any roll ending in a 0 over your Skill as a
Fumble, so, 00, 99, 90, 88, and so on If you fumble a Channelling
Test, you suffer a Miscast Roll 1d100 and consult the Major
Miscast Table
Interruptions
Concentration is vital when channelling If you are distracted
by anything — loud noises, suffering damage, flashing lights,
or similar — you must pass a Hard (–20) Cool Test, or suffer a
Minor Miscast and lose all SL you have accrued in the Extended
Channelling Test so far
Repelling the Winds
Wearing colours appropriate to the Wind of Magic you are
manipulating helps attract the magic to you This is the reason most
Magisters choose to dress in the traditional garb of their order
All Casting and Channelling Tests suffer a –1 SL penalty if you
are dressed inappropriately for the Wind of Magic you are trying
to attract, as determined by the GM Specifically, metal and
leather armour repel most of the Winds: metal is laden with the
golden wind Chamon, while leather retains traces of the amber
Ghur As such, spellcasters wearing armour suffer –1 SL penalty
to all Casting and Channelling Tests for every Armour Point
on the location with the most armour Casters with the Arcane
Magic (Metal) Talent may wear metal armour without penalty;
those with Arcane Magic (Beasts) Talent may ignore penalties
from leather armour
Dispelling
If a spell targets you, or a point you can see within Willpower yards,
you may oppose the Casting Test with Language (Magick) as you
chant a counterspell Make an Opposed Language (Magick) Test
If you win the Opposed Test, you dispel the incoming spell; if
you lose, the spell uses the SL of the Opposed Test to determine
whether the casting was successful as normal You may only
attempt to dispel a single spell every Round
Dispelling Persistent Spells
If a spell has a lasting effect, you may attempt to dispel that spell
for your Action This is done by making an Extended Language
(Magick) Test When your SL reaches the CN of the ongoing
spell, you successfully dispel it
Multiple spellcasters attempting to dispel the same spell each roll
separately If they cast using the same Lore, they may decide to
make an Assisted Test instead
Using Warpstone
Officially the use of warpstone is precluded by the powers that be
Unofficially, I can say that it is officially never used within this
college Officially, I cannot say what unofficial uses it might have But
unofficially, I might be able to say it has certain unofficial uses But
certainly it is officially unofficial
–Wilhelm Holswig-Schliestein, Grey Guardian, Raconteur, and Liar
magi c VIII
237
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Warpstone is such a rich source of power that even a small
fragment of the stuff will offer enough magic to power any spell
in short order Of course, the wisdom of powering any spell with
Warpstone, and the wisdom of carrying Warpstone upon your
person, is debateable
A wizard using Warpstone when Casting and Channelling
doubles their SL for the appropriate tests In addition, Casting
or Channelling with Warpstone is a corrupting influence See
page 182 for details of Corruption, and page 236 for casting near
Malignant Influences
Multiple Arcane Lores
If you’re an Elf, you can learn a number of Arcane Lores
equal to your Willpower Bonus If you have Willpower 65,
you can learn 6 of the 8 Arcane Lores However, doing this
takes time and effort You can’t purchase a new Arcane Magic
Talent until you have mastered your previous one by taking at
least 20 Advances in the Channelling Skill of, and learning
at least 8 spells from, your Lore Alternatively, any wizard can
learn a single Dark Lore in addition to another Lore, assuming
they are foolish enough and can find a teacher or forbidden
grimoire to study
Options: The Swirling Winds
The Winds of Magic swirl in unfathomable patterns and
unpredictable gusts Before every scene — or even every round
in magically turbulent areas — the GM can roll for the strength
of the Winds relevant to the scene, to see whether they are
blowing strongly or weakly The modifier can be added to your
Casting and Channelling Tests The GM could decide to do
this only in areas where the Winds of Magic are particularly
wild, for example in the aftermath of powerful spells, at
magical loci, near Chaotic portals, and when Morrslieb is at
its fullest If you have the Second Sight Talent, an Easy (+40)
Perception Test will spot such disturbances

Overcasting
For every +2 SL you achieve in a Casting Test, you may add
additional Range, Area of Effect, Duration, or Targets equal to
the initial value listed in the spell Spells with a Range and Target
of ‘You’ may only ever target the spellcaster making the Casting
Test Spells with a Range of ‘Touch’ may not be extended If the
Spell has no Duration, you cannot extend it
You may choose the same option more than once For instance, if
you achieved + 4 SL above your Casting Number on a spell with
a Target of 1, you may now Target 3 individuals Certain Spells
may have additional, optional benefits for additional SL noted in
their description
Grimoires
If you start play with a Grimoire, it is up to the GM to
determine how many spells your master has recorded within
it Some Masters are more generous than others, but most
provide at least four new spells to study, and few provide
more than eight If you have a spell Memorised, you do not
need access to your Grimoire to cast it If you have not yet
memorised a spell, you may use your Grimoire to cast it
using both your hands This doubles the CN of the spell and
exposes your Grimoire to possible damage or theft

The Colleges of Magic
and Petty Spells
Petty spells, or cantrips as the Colleges often prefer to call
them, use miniscule amounts of whatever winds are around,
and are often learned instinctively by spellcasters as their talent
first manifests As such, once their training within the Colleges
has begun, Magisters rarely learn new Petty spells Technically,
they are classed as Witchcraft, and are thus illegal in the
Empire
While the Colleges of Magic generally turn a blind eye to
their use given they are so minor, Witch Hunters are not
always so understanding
magi c VIII

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Petty Spells
For the few Humans blessed — or cursed, depending upon your
point of view — with the spark of magic, it generally manifests
around puberty, and almost always before 25 summers have
passed The first indications of impending witchery are often
little tricks, knacks, cantrips, or similar, showing the wizard-to-be
should probably be trained for everyone else’s safety
For Elves, this is just a part of growing up, and those with interest
in magic are schooled to develop their burgeoning talents For
Humans, assuming they avoid being lynched, it likely means
years of training as an apprentice to a Magister from one of the
Eight Colleges of Magic, after which they should never use the
little tricks they learned when young again But most do
As Petty spells are not formally codified, they have many
different names Players are encouraged to devise their own, more
characterful names, reflecting their personality

Arcane Spells
The Arcane spells represent common formulations of the lingua
praestantia How these spells manifest in practice will depend on
your Arcane Magic Talent For instance, a spellcaster with the
Arcane Magic (Fire) Talent casting Drop may cause the object to
overheat, while one with Arcane Magic (Shadows) may make it
slightly insubstantial, causing the object to literally slip between
the target’s fingers
Treat Arcane spells as extra options for every Lore of Magic,

Witch Magic
The following provides two lists of six spells for spellcasters nor
yet absorbed into the Colleges of Magic, who are almost always
on the run from Witch Hunters and Sigmarites
The Lore of Hedgecraft
The Hedgefolk believe their Lore is a gift from the Gods,
referring to their spellcasters as the Blessed Few Due to their
ancient traditions and ingrained belief, their spells cannot be
cast without ingredients, which are an integral part of their
spellcasting process
Fortunately, the ingredients they use are easily found on the
fringes of settlements and are usually herbs or plants You receive
1 + SL ingredients on a successful foraging roll, using Lore
(Herbalism), as described under Gathering Food and Herbs on
page 127, or you can buy them for 5 brass pennies each
Ingredients: Hedgefolk use easily sourced local materials
prepared to exacting standards using special tools So, ingredients
may include things such as the wings of a dragonfly killed with a
silver pin, rods of poplar polished with beeswax on Sonnstill, or
bones buried beneath a hedgerow for a winter’s month

At the end of the spell you will be pulled suddenly back to your
body If your body is killed while you are walking the Hedge, your
spirit will wander aimlessly for eternity

winds and the potentially horrific results Each time practitioners
of Witchcraft roll on a Miscast table, they also gain 1 Corruption
point Further, you may inflict one Bleeding Condition on anyone
targeted by spells from the Lore of Witchcraft Lastly, channelling
or casting spells from this Lore automatically require a roll on
the Minor Miscast table unless cast with an ingredient , where
the ingredient provides no further protection should you roll a
Miscast Fortunately, ingredients for the Lore of Witchcraft are
cheap and readily available: body parts of small animals for the
most part Ingredients cost a spell’s CN in brass pennies, instead
of silver shillings, to purchase Alternatively, a Witch may forage
for parts, using the Outdoor Survival skill: a successful foraging
roll receives 1 + SL ingredients, as described under Gathering
Food and Herbs on page 127

Range: Willpower yards
Target: 1
Duration: Willpower Bonus Rounds
Your magic pierces deep within your target, flooding the soul with
an acute awareness of their broken dreams The target’s Initiative
Characteristic drops to 10, if it was not already lower, as the mind
turns inwards On the target’s Turn, all movement is randomised
as determined by the GM as the character bemoans life, lewdly
telling all what should have been as hands are flung in the air
Further, the target can only perform an Action if a Challenging
(+0) Cool Test is first passed; if failed, the Target is far too busy
bemoaning what could have been to do anything else
Lore of Tzeentch
Tzeentch is the Master of Magic, Treachery, and Lies The Lore
of Tzeentch epitomises this, as it boasts a multitude of powerful
spells focussing upon change, all drawing heavily from the Grey,

You channel fine strands of traitorous mergings of the Winds

undermining desires, and fanning fires of discontent The target
can no longer use Talents, and doesn’t add Skill Advances
when making Skill Tests, meaning the target only Tests against

 The Gamemaster
Being the Gamemaster (GM) is the best thing ever While the
Players are busy with their single, measly Character, you’re in
charge of the entire world! If you’re a new GM this can be a little
daunting, but don’t worry, you’ll get the hang of it quickly, and
we’ll walk you through the basics here
The most important responsibility of a GM is to make sure everyone
has fun, including you You’ll be juggling roles of storyteller,
umpire, and host, but don’t lose sight of the fact that the reason
everyone is playing the game is to have a good time Balance your
storytelling with allowing Players spotlight time and autonomy
in their actions If a scene isn’t working, wrap it up quickly and
move on Balance the game rules with everyone’s enjoyment of the
game — if something seems counter-intuitive or is taking too long,
change it Always focus on what your group finds fun
You are the world Everything the Players interact with comes
from you You provide the world they explore Your descriptions
tell them what they see, hear, touch, smell, and taste You’ll play
the role of the people and creatures with which they interact You
describe the outcome of every action they take and determine
how the game rules are applied
You are the rules Make sure you understand the rules so the
game runs smoothly and quickly Be familiar with the rulebook
so you can find what you need Choose quickly if you are going to
resolve an action with a GM decision or if you want the Player to
make a Test This choice will partly be a matter of personal style
— do you and your Players like relying on the Character sheets
to define what happens or do you prefer to save dice rolls for only
the most important situations? Correctly and openly interpreting
the results of Tests demonstrates to your Players that their actions
have consequences, and that you are consistent and fair in your
application of the rules
You are the plot Before the game you’ll prepare the adventure,
making sure you know what events are planned to take place,
and who is involved in them It is generally a good idea to have
some contingency plans in place should the Players leap to the
wrong conclusions and go off at a tangent (they will do this more
often than you might think!) Make sure you have all the game
information for the main characters in the adventure, along with
anyone or anything the Characters might have to fight Be familiar
with the adventure’s background and the area it takes place in, and
you will be able to improvise effectively You can also prepare some
stock events to use in case improvisation is required
You are the leader Encourage good playing by making sure
that everyone has a chance to participate, and that the game
runs smoothly Remind Players that rules discussions take place

outside the game, and that you need to be able to get on with
running the game to achieve maximum fun! Be thoughtful and
respectful of your Players Be aware of content that might be
uncomfortable for some people, for instance graphic violence,
sex, or horror Check it’s okay before those subjects come up in a
game Justify your authority by being fair to everyone, consistent
in how you apply the rules, and running the best Sigmar-blessed
game this side of the Worlds Edge Mountains
General Advice
There’s a lot of advice on running games out there It’s a huge
subject and requires much more space than we have here, so we’re
adding a lot of advice to the Cubicle 7 website – keep checking
back as we plan to keep building up that section The rest of this
chapter provides some specific advice for what to do at different
stages of a game
As a starter — or refresher for experienced GMs — here’s a
condensed list of things to think about:
	 Get to know this book well
	 Give the players what they want from the game without
ruining your own plans
	 Make sure new groups of Characters have reasons to be
adventuring together
	 Consider how to handle or bypass content a player might
not find to their taste
	 Bookmark sections you will be returning to often, such as
Chapter 8: Magic if one of your players is a wizard
	 Be aware of plot devices and how to use them to good
effect
	 Ensure the challenges you set your Players are achievable,
and that any enemies that need to be defeated can be
defeated
	 Intersperse some light relief into horror-heavy games
	 Decide which parts of the adventure should be easy and
quickly resolved, and which should be the most dramatic
and challenging
	 What parts of the adventure need to be successful to make
the story satisfying, and how will you ensure they happen
without making your players feel too railroaded?
	 When it comes to the results of Tests, be firm but fair
	 Be ready to make a big deal of players using or gaining Fate
and Resilience points
	 Make a list of descriptive phrases appropriate for
the locations the adventure is taking place in, to help
improvised scenes
	 If in doubt, err on the side of having fun
	 Give Characters challenges that require improvisation or
creative thinking
	 You can’t detail everyone the Characters meet, but a single
feature — an accent, catchphrase or tic — helps make
everyone memorable!
Rules Notes
As you play more games of WFRP, the rules will become
increasingly familiar To give you a head start, these points are
worth initially bearing in mind:
	 Tests: Use of the different methods of resolving actions (see
page 150) give you considerable control over the pace of the
game — use them!
	 Fortune Points: Encourage your players to spend these
during play or you will find cautious players repeatedly have
several at the end of the session unused, and have probably
failed some Tests they could have passed
	 Advantage: Advantage speeds up combat by adding
momentum for winning each round Remember all
Advantage is lost when you lose a round, or if you are hit by
ranged or magical attacks — Advantage is not as scary as it
first appears, even if it stacks high Should Characters become
overwhelmed, they may wish to consider disengaging, then
either fleeing or attacking from afar Characters can also
spend Resilience points to automatically win a round and
eliminate any build-up of Advantage their foes might have
secured
	 Opposed Tests: Almost all combat Tests are Opposed,
meaning that someone always wins, even if both combatants
effectively fail their individual Tests Remember, the
difference in SL will always secure a winner This means
even very poor combatants will be landing blows right from
the outset — just without any skill or finesse
	 No Opposition: Should you find opponents who refuse to
defend themselves for fear of rolling poorly in an Opposed
Test, then clearly their Characters are doing nothing,
meaning they count as Helpless (see page 162)
Character Creation
Before your first WFRP game begins, the Players will need to
create Characters, or choose one of the ready-made characters
provided on the Cubicle 7 website or the WFRP Starter Set
The ready-made Characters are already formed into a group and
The Gamemaster IX
259
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
are ready to go, but if your Players are creating their own, you
should guide them through the process
Character Creation can take a while, so it can be worth devoting
the first game session to it, so let the Players know this in advance
to manage their expectations You can take Players through each
step of character creation, but Players having their own rulebooks
can speed things up considerably Guide new Players through
how the different parts of their Character will be used in the
game, and encourage Players to coordinate their choices so they
can build a broadly capable group A good spread of Classes gives
both you and the Players more options during play If the group
has no spellcasters for example, you can’t run adventures that
require the Players follow magical clues
Encourage Players to involve other Characters in their own
Character’s background and provide suggestions to help This
helps bind the group together and should make it easier for them
to choose a Group Ambition Avoid creating a group of disparate
desperadoes who won’t work together and never cooperate on
anything That gets old fast and can lead to unsatisfying gaming
experiences
The group should have a reason to stick together, work together,
and be motivated to engage with the adventures awaiting them
A good way to make sure the group has this is to simply ask your
Players to explain exactly why their Characters work together,
and why they will adventure together in future You may be
surprised at just how inventive your Players can be
Having a good idea of the adventures you have planned means
you can weave connections to them into each Character’s
background If you’ve got a smuggler in the group, and you know
part of the forthcoming adventures involve a smuggling ring,
work your smugglers into that Character’s background If a Chaos
Cult is central to the adventure, perhaps decide that an important
member of one Character’s family will be a secret member of the
cult These personal details will make for a more involving game
that really immerses the Players in the game world
If your group are not cooperating, you can always try external
motivations For example: the promise of an incredible reward the
Characters can’t resist, or being ‘asked’ to do work by a powerful
patron who won’t take refusal kindly
The Character creation phase is also a great place to discuss the
kind of game everyone wants to play Identifying content to
avoid — for instance graphic violence, sex, or horror — is just
as important as determining the game your Players will enjoy
Some people might not be comfortable talking about this in
front of others, so make sure you give everyone the chance to
communicate with you privately about it, and don’t ask for the
reasons why — the preference is enough If in any doubt, err on
the side of caution, and remember the goal is for everyone to
have fun
At the Table
During sessions where you are running games of WFRP as the
GM, here’s what you’ll be doing:
1 Set the scene
At the start of the game, the GM should give a summary of what
has happened in the adventure so far — in the first session of an
adventure this will instead be some background to the adventure
about to begin It’s the recap part of a TV series: ‘Previously on
WFRP…’: keep it short and sweet
Next, you’ll describe where the Characters are and what is
happening around them Provide immediate prompts to action
— make sure that the game gets off to an exciting start End with
an event or question that means the Players have to get involved
right away — even a simple knock on their door, or thrown jar of
ale arcing gently across the taproom towards them immediately
leads to action!
2 Listen to the Players
The Players will react to the scene-setting and will interpret
what is going on, often in a way that us GMs would describe as
‘interesting’ As GM, you already know the plot of the adventure,
but the Players will need to puzzle it out, perhaps with a false start
or two Don’t panic if they head off in the wrong direction — they’ll
get there in the end, and you’ll have a lot of fun along the way
So, resolve their immediate actions in the game while listening
carefully to how they are going to react to the wider plot to give
260
IX
you thinking time for the next part Make sure each Player has
the opportunity to contribute — actively ask any Player who
hasn’t yet participated what their Character is going to do
3 Describe the consequences of the Players’
actions
You’ll react to the Player’s actions depending on what they are
doing If they are talking to one of the character’s you’ve described
as being present in the scene, you’ll respond to them in the role of
that person If they are taking actions that require Tests to resolve,
you’ll decide which Skill is being tested, any modifiers on the
Test, and interpret the outcome — what happens because of that
action Sometimes this will be the start of a sequence of events,
which other Players might join, or it may be a simple action that
is quickly resolved Again, make sure everyone has an opportunity
to do something and contribute to the game Ask quieter Players
directly to make sure they get a go
This Player-directed phase of the game can go on for quite some
time, as you all take turns to move the story forward, and the GM
is largely in a reactive role Even experienced GMs can be amazed
at the tangents Players can pursue, and some very memorable
games come from this improvised style of play
4 Describe events from the ongoing plot
While the Player-directed phase is going on, the GM will be aware
of the adventure plot circling in the Aethyr At the appropriate
times, events from the plot will come crashing in The Players will
now be reacting to events before formulating their new plan and
pursuing it in their inevitably haphazard style These moments
can be used as course-corrections, giving additional clues on what
is really happening, and helping get Players back on track
Be careful not to be too blunt or obvious with these events
however — no-one likes to feel like they are being forced towards
an inevitable conclusion Allow Players the autonomy to really
mess things up, but also don’t be afraid to modify your plot on the
hoof if it makes for a more enjoyable game
Travel
Travelling in the Old World can be dangerous Brigands, mutants,
and beasts lurk in the shadows, an ever-present threat, perhaps
joined by those specifically out to thwart the Players’ actions
Some parts of the Empire have been corrupted by magic, Chaos,
Necromancy, or worse, and can easily consume the unwary
traveller Even the weather poses a threat!
261
The Gamemaster IX
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
It’s up to you how you want to represent the dangers of travel
in your game Sometimes you’ll just want to get on with the
adventure and deal with journeys with a simple description of
how long the journey was, and the key points along the way Most
journeys will either be by road or by river, with road the more
dangerous, and cheaper, option
Travel by Road
The roads of the Reikland are often crude but reliable The routes
between major cities are relatively safe and well-maintained
However, far-flung routes can be little more than muddy tracks
Regardless of the quality, all roads need to be maintained, so most
are tolled
There is an extensive network of coach routes throughout the
province The busiest routes have coaches running several times
per day The many Coaching Houses of the Reikland are in fierce
competition, so the prices are often reasonable and reliability
is good The Four Seasons is the biggest coach company, and is
represented along all the major routes
Roadside inns are often placed at the convenience of the
Coaching Houses Therefore, journeying by foot, especially away
from the major routes, runs the risk of not reaching a safe place
to rest before nightfall
Travel by River
River journeys are often straightforward and perhaps even
relaxing However, this relies on finding a boat going to and
from convenient locations Dedicated passenger barges only
travel between the major towns and cities, but can be bribed or
persuaded to drop people off along the way Getting to more
obscure locations usually requires hitching a ride with a cargo
boat, which can be difficult for large parties
Travel Prices
The prices listed in Travel Costs do not include meals, lodging,
or fodder, although coaches and passenger boats usually charge
for the whole package for longer journeys Package prices can be
worked out by combining travel with food and boarding prices
On some ferries, lodging is not required, as passengers sleep on
the vessel, either on deck or in a private cabin
Cargo barge travel-costs should be individually haggled with
barge masters Often, such passage can be secured for a greatly
reduced price, or even for free, if the passenger is willing to work
and they know what they’re doing
High class travel is available and de rigueur among the nobility,
and can cost many times the listed price, typically ten times or
more Opulent passenger vessels ply between the great cities of
the Empire, like the famous Emperor Luitpold plying the River
Talebec between Altdorf and Talabheim
Travel Costs
All the costs listed here are per mile travelled, and are loose
guides only Faster coaches and barges generally cost twice as
much Slower examples cost as little as half as much Increase
or decrease speed by +/– 1 for faster or slower examples
Transport Movement Cost Distance
COACH 6
Inside –/2 per mile
Outside –/1 per mile
BARGE 8
Cabin –/5 per mile
Deck –/2 per mile
CAB 6 –/3 per district
FERRY 4 –/1 per 20 yards
Travel Times
Use Movement to determine travel speed in miles per hour So, if a
party’s slowest Movement was 3, it would travel at approximately
3 miles per hour
Taking into account rests, necessary stops, and a typical
topography, a party can travel the equivalent of 6 hours a day
without requiring Endurance Tests If travelling faster or farther,
give a Fatigue Condition to those failing this Test, with extra
Fatigue if Encumbered (see page 293)
Barge speed can increase or decrease by up to 30% if going
downstream or upstream, as you determine is appropriate
Travel Events
Whether detailing daily travel or simply choosing to allow the
party to pay an appropriate fee and then arrive at their chosen
destination, every now and again it’s good to throw in some travel
events It’s an opportunity to show off a different aspect of the
Old World, or to give a change of pace to the adventure
An intrigue-focused game can sometimes do with a clearly
defined ‘goodies vs baddies’ Beastmen attack A tense, bleak
session can benefit from a night’s entertainment sharing camp
with a travelling circus Further, you can work these encounters
into your ongoing narrative if you wish
Finding the burned-out caravans of the circus later in the journey
is a poignant way of making the antagonists’ actions personal
Travel events are also great for foreshadowing events to come, or
reinforcing the themes of an adventure
262
IX
It is up to you how much of an issue you want these travel events
to be for your players Some could simply consist of a brief
description, while others could form the basis of an entire session
of play Some GMs prefer to roll 1d10 per day of travel and
have an event occur on the roll of an 8 (signifying the 8-pointed
symbol of Chaos — something unexpected and random has
occurred), others like a single event for each journey of a day or
more This is left for you to determine, though if you are playing a
printed adventure by Cubicle 7 that includes a journey, suggested
events and travel times will be included So, the following table
can be used as you prefer, and presumes a single event for the
journey travelled
263
The Gamemaster IX
1d10 Event
1 Restful Journey: The journey is blessedly uneventful, the Characters get good rest, the scenery is particularly
inspiring, and perhaps they meet an NPC healer or helpful priest The Characters can heal all Wounds and
recover all Fatigued Conditions
2 How Interesting!: A chance encounter on the road with other travellers, a particularly good inn or shrine, or
an intriguing ancient ruin gives a wonderful story to share
3 Now That’s Useful!: The Characters find out something relevant to their adventure — gossip, a lost message,
a sight they weren’t meant to witness, or similar
4 Tiring Journey!: The route is blocked A bridge could be down, a river blocked or road flooded, or some
other insurmountable obstacle One Character makes a Average (+20) Outdoor Survival Test to find a good
alternative route, otherwise everyone arrives a day late, with a Fatigued Condition
5 Pursued!: An enemy picks up the Characters’ trail and has to be dealt with or put off the scent before they
can reach their destination If they don’t have an obvious enemy yet, look to the Characters’ backgrounds —
there will be something in there somewhere The confrontation could be violent unless they can talk their way
out of it, and losing their tail could add days to their journey
6 Thieves!: Somehow the Characters get robbed Perhaps it was someone travelling with them, sharing their
campfire for the night or just a brief conversation on the road Do they stop to chase down their belongings
or write it off as a risk of the adventurous life?
7 Not Them Again!: A rival or other source of annoyance plagues the Characters on their journey Play this for
laughs but make them genuinely annoying and a recurring minor bane of the Character’s lives Never enough
to fall to violence, but close They could be a rival guild member obsessed with ‘winning’ over a member of the
group, or a coach passenger with an especially irritating demeanour
8 Bad Influence!: The Characters encounter someone who appears to help them but has sinister intentions
That bad-smelling guy who knows a shortcut through the Garden of Morr and insists you go first The
charming old aristocrat who invites you to stay for dinner in her ancestral home The scruffy woman who
knows where to find all the ‘best’ mushrooms Have fun!
9 Even Nature Hates You!: The Characters find themselves in danger from nature Deadly animals, lightning
storms, disease, insects, you name it This could result in violence, or in them receiving a Condition, or in a
small but vicious encounter when they choose the wrong shepherd’s hut as a shelter
10 Attacked!: The Characters are attacked on their journey It could be an unlucky encounter relevant to the
area they are travelling through (Beastmen in the deep forest, for instance) or something planned by their
opponents (hired thugs to stop the Characters reaching their destination) If they fail a Routine (+20)
Perception Test, they may even be ambushed! 
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
You might like to give Players the opportunity to avoid nasty
events with a successful Perception Test, or Outdoor Survival, or
whatever other Test makes sense at the time If they are travelling
in paid-for transportation, you might decide that gives them help
in overcoming any adversities
After the Game
Try to end your session in a narratively satisfying way, either
with a moment of resolution, revelation, mystery, or the dreaded
cliffhanger, leaving your Players waiting until the next session
before learning what happens to their Characters
Awarding XP
At the end of every session you should award your players XP
This is your opportunity to reward your Players for cooperation,
good roleplaying and making the experience fun Remember that
it’s better to use the carrot than the stick — don’t punish players
who didn’t cooperate, reward those who did People will soon get
the message!
Additional bonuses of 25-50 XP could be awarded for excellent
roleplaying, teamwork, or otherwise getting in the spirit of things
If you are playing a published adventure from Cubicle 7, it will
list suggested XP awards for every session
Recovering Fate and Resilience
A Player spending a point of Fate or Resilience is a significant
event Characters generally have few of these points, and they are
powerful, so they should be spent wisely After all, spending Fate
or Resilience will also reduce the number of Fortune and Resolve
points a character has available
Awarding Players Fate and Resilience points is likewise a rare
and special occurrence The end of a long adventure or campaign
of significant importance could be rewarded with a Fate point
Or a Character achieving something of extraordinary personal
significance could be awarded a Resilience point If you are
playing printed adventures from Cubicle 7, obvious points
to award Fate points, and sometimes Resilience points, are
included

 Glorious Reik land 
To his Imperial Majesty, Emperor Karl-Franz the First, by the Grace of the Gods, Elector Count and Grand Prince of Reikland, Prince of
Altdorf, Count of the West March, Defender of Sigmar’s Faith, do I commend this text, an examination of his most illustrious realm, the
Grand Princedom of Reikland, heartland of Our Holy Empire Long may he rule!
Herein learn of the mightiest province of the Empire, and of its hard-working people who are united by the worship of the God-King Sigmar
Admire the Elector Counts of the Reikland who have led the glorious Empire for almost a century, and their generous patronage that enriches
our homeland beyond measure Wonder at the Reikland’s impressive canal network, extensive roadworks, sophisticated farming, and its rapidly
developing mercantile class, all of which confirm the Reikland as a true jewel of the Empire
Marvel at this richest, most cosmopolitan of all imperial realms, and see that it is a cultural, magical, and academic powerhouse without
par, attracting the most impressive artisans, wizards, and scholars to its many learned institutions, cementing its reputation as the greatest
domain of the Old World
Truly, to be born a Reiklander is to be born blessed by the Gods Themselves Give thanks to Sigmar and be praised
– The words of Holy Mother Halma Habermann of Sigmar
– Recorded faithfully by the humble scribe Melistius of the Order of the Anvil in 2510 IC
Standing proud in the heart of the Old World, the Reikland is the richest and most powerful of the Empire’s grand provinces
Known for its engineers, wizards, and merchants, and for being the birthplace of the Cult of Sigmar, it is a realm of soaring
mountains, snaking rivers, dark forests, and powerful trading centres From his throne in the city of high-spired Altdorf, Emperor
Karl-Franz I rules not only the Reikland, but all the Empire that lies beyond
X
The Lie of the Land
The Reikland lies in the shadow of the forbidding Grey
Mountains, and its lowlands are entirely forested save for cleared
regions around the grand province’s multitude of prosperous
towns and villages It has no coastline, but the Reik — the
largest river in the Old World that defines most of the Reikland’s
twisting eastern and northern borders — is so wide and deep an
entire navy of warships and merchant vessels plies its length
Much of the land near the Reik is waterlogged and marshy, with
long stretches of bogs, swamps, and dangerous mud plains, the
largest of which is the Grootscher Marsh on the border with
the Wasteland to the west Farther inland, the Reikland climbs
upwards to the craggy Skaag Hills and the haunted Hägercrybs,
two forested uplands hiding isolated regions nigh-on untouched
by human hand The forests eventually give way as the land rises
towards the Grey Mountains, the Reikland’s natural border with
Bretonnia to the south, and opens up to a wide plain of fertile
foothills and open grassland known as the Vorbergland
The Mountains, Foothills, and Vorbergland
The Reikland is a rugged realm, its undulating forests broken
by peaks, crags, and ridges, many topped by ruined castles and
watchtowers from previous, war-torn eras Rising above this
multitude of minor ranges are the Hägercrybs and the Skaag
Hills, two highland regions in central and northern Reikland,
their heavily fortified mines responsible for much of the realm’s
recent prosperity Farther south, the trees thin out to the exposed
plains and foothills of the fertile Vorbergland that lie between the
Reikwald forest and the dangerous Grey Mountains, peaks that
offer enormous wealth and danger in equal measure
The Grey Mountains
The forbidding peaks of the Grey Mountains are riddled with
crumbling tunnels and topped with ruined skybridges from the
time when Dwarfs ruled the region But that era has passed,
and only a handful of determined clans remain to defend their
ancestral holds, with recently reclaimed Karak Azgaraz and
towering Karak Ziflin being two of the largest still standing
The mountains and the tunnels beneath them are now overrun
with Orcs and Goblins, Mountain Trolls, Skaven, and worse
While this makes the Grey Mountains especially dangerous,
many claim the fallen Dwarf holds hide treasures lost to time,
so the foolhardy and desperate are drawn to the ancient halls like
moths to a flame Few survive their greed
Clinging precariously to the craggy edge of the Grey Mountains,
the southern lords of the Reikland have sunk many mines seeking
to extract the significant mineral and metal wealth of the range
These are protected by lone watchtowers and high fortresses that
stand guard against attack from the mountains, each surrounded
by the rubble of older fortifications that failed
So high is the glacial spine of the Grey Mountains that it is all
but impassable, forming a near impenetrable border between
the Reikland and the Bretonnian duchies to the south-east
Only two reliable passes pierce the frozen heights: the welldefended
Axe-Bite Pass guarded by the fortresses of Helmgart
and Monfort, and the winding Grey Lady Pass leading from
Ubersreik to Parravon Both passes are heavily patrolled and
taxed, leading some impoverished merchants and smugglers
to hire mountain guides to lead them across lesser passes such
as the Crooked Corridor or Durak Way, an undertaking few
would recommend
The Hägercrybs
Dominating the centre of the Reikland, the mist-shrouded
Hägercrybs extend from the Princedom of Altdorf in the north
all the way to the Freiburg of Ubersreik in the south, and are so
heavily forested that no road pierces through their heights from
east to west, resulting in long journeys for those traveling from
one side to the other
The foothills are mostly populated by sheep and their shepherds,
but, antiquarians claim, the Hägercrybs were once the sacred
burial ground of the Unberogens, the Human tribe of Sigmar
Himself Supporting this, ancient cairns can be seen rising
from clearings on many of the highlands, some of which are
also marked by looming menhirs Perhaps because of these, the
Hägercrybs have a foul reputation for being haunted, and few
are willing to stray too deep into its forests It is said those who
do encounter thick fogs rising from ancient barrows, with moans
of the dead echoing from within Locally, such talk is nervously
dismissed as the ravings of shepherds drunk on too much hard
cider, for the alternative is to believe tales of ancient kings hungry
for the blood of the living
Ignoring such talk, lords of the Hägercrybs repeatedly order
mines be sunk into the hills in the search of rare metals and
minerals Most fail, their miners never seen again, but a handful
are successful, and have brought considerable wealth to the area
The Skaag Hills
The rocky Skaag Hills lie to the west of the River Bögen and run
along the southern bank of the Reik before falling beneath the
trees of the Duchy of Gorland Near the centre, the Reikwald
recedes from the stony crags and layers of stratified rock rise to
the scree-laden highlands of the Prie Ridge A single road crosses
the gentler slopes of the Skaag Hills to the south, starting at
Trosreut in the shadow of Castle Grauenberg and wending its
way through to Holthausen, but many minor tracks and trails
also cross the region, most of which started as goat tracks
Once, the hillsides were bustling with small mines boasting rich
veins of silver and iron Down through the centuries most of
these played out, leaving many abandoned settlements, many
of which the forest reclaimed Locals now approach such ruins
cautiously, for hunters, outlaws, and far more sinister folk are said
to make use of what intact buildings remain

The Vorbergland
Between the threatening peaks of the Grey Mountains and the
deep forests of the Reikwald lies the Vorbergland, a hilly region
extending the length of the Reikland known for its fertile valleys,
rolling grasslands, and windswept plains
The productive south-eastern provinces around Böhrn,
Ubersreik, Stimmigen, and Dunkelberg are known locally as
Suden Vorbergland, and are the most heavily cultivated regions
of the Reikland They are peppered with many flourishing towns,
villages, farms, and vineyards, and are often referred to as ‘Ranald’s
Garden’ for the vast quantities of wine they produce for export
Further west, the Vorbergland is tormented by frequent Orc
and Goblin attacks from the mountains, meaning much of the
land is sparsely populated, little more than a hunting ground for
wild animals and monsters from the peaks This makes the local
baronies and duchies a popular destination for game hunters and
natural historians from the Imperial Zoo seeking to capture rare
creatures, though only the unwise travel this region without a
heavy guard and knowledgeable guide
Drachenberg
Soaring high above central Vorbergland, its base wrapped by
the shimmering River Bögen, the twisting peak known as the
Drachenberg can be seen for miles around Whenever trouble
arises, the nearby townsfolk of Wheburg cast an eye towards the
mountain and make the comet sign of Sigmar to ward evil, for
Drachenberg has a fell reputation Its name roughly translates to
‘Dragon Peak’ and, true to its name, the mountain has long been
a favoured haunt of the great beasts, as well as to other monstrous
creatures such as Basilisks, Wyverns, and Manticores
The immense Red Dragon, Caledair — the ‘Scythe of Fire’
— once made her lair in caves near the peak of the mountain,
and hunted across the fields of the Vorbergland for uncounted
generations While she has not been seen for more than a century,
none can say for certain if she is truly gone or if she sleeps in the
mountain still
The Drachenberg is treacherous, with steep sides that thwart
climbers, and no easy routes to its sheer summit Though trees
clog its foothills, they are sparse along its upper slopes and the
top soil is very loose, which has caused more than one imprudent
climber to slide free to a broken death Even so, the brave and the
foolish still attempt to climb the Drachenberg, for who knows
what treasures may lie hidden within its unknown heights?
The Grim, Dark Forests
The widespread forests of the Reikland are regarded as some of
the safest in the Empire, but stray from the busy rivers and treelined
roads and such impulsive talk is soon forgotten Uncharted
miles of towering oak, pine, elm, and beech hide much more than
desperate bandits and wild animals And the deeper one goes, the
more dangerous it is
The Reikwald
The Reikwald blankets almost all the Reikland outside the
Vorbergland, only thinning around the jagged Skaag Hills or
where it is cleared by the towns and villages lining the Reik river
and its many tributaries Most travellers through the region prefer
the relative safety of river travel to journeying along uncertain
roads, and with good reason; the Reikwald is a favoured haunt
of outcasts, cut-throats, and other lawless folk While all major
routes are patrolled by road wardens, their numbers are too
few and the roads too long, so it’s not uncommon to encounter
upturned coaches and other signs of banditry The majority of the
open clearings and abandoned ruins from past wars are claimed
as camps by outlaws or by one of the herds of Beastmen roaming
the deeper wood, and forays to clear these isolated places by
regiments of the Reikland State Army are not uncommon
X
In most parts, the Reikwald’s canopy is not so overgrown as to
block sunlight, but its depths are frequently gloomy and heavy
fogs are common, especially along the marshier stretches of the
river Reik Scholars claim before the Empire was founded the
Unberogen tribe of Humans ranged across this misty forest
alongside older tribes whose names are now lost to memory
Concentric rings of carved standing stones called ‘oghams’ still
exist from this era, though many are overgrown and almost
impossible to find without a guide Isolated communities still
following ancient ways — old beliefs said to predate the coming
of Sigmar — are said to hold such sites sacred Intellectuals from
the Colleges of Magic postulate terrible battles were once fought
for these ancient, megalithic sites, and it’s not uncommon to find
richer magisters funding explorations into the Reikwald’s depths
to learn more about the magical stones
Bloodpine Woods
South of Altdorf an outcrop of pine trees grows down the
southern face of the magical Amber Hills and spills into the
depths of the Reikwald Called bloodpine for its deep-maroon
wood, the lumber here is greatly desired by the artisans of Altdorf,
and is most often used to produce exquisite furniture destined
for the high-class markets of Marienburg and Nuln Recently,
bloodpine has become hard to source, for the Bloodpine Woods
are plagued by Forest Goblins of the Spiderclaw tribe who’ve
managed to tame a handful of swift-moving Giant Spiders
Few dare to work there now, for those attempting to cut the
trees simply disappear, their cries echoing from the mists high
in the trees before suddenly falling silent This has, of course,
only served to increase the value of bloodpine, which has deeply
enraged purchasers, several of whom have taken to hiring
mercenaries and private parties to clear the Goblins, figuring
it is cheaper to throw bodies at the problem than pay more for
their new filing cabinet
The Grissenwald
The south-easternmost end of the Reikwald branches
southwards along the Stirland border and thins out as it heads
upriver towards the City-State of Nuln This wide section of the
forest is known locally as the Grissenwald, a tight woodland
packed with distorted trees and twisted undergrowth, the depths
of which are said to be swarming with Beastmen, Witches, and
tribes of feral Mutants Because of this, most local woodsmen
travel in groups and seldom stay outdoors come nightfall, and
its commonplace to find fluttering bills posted on roadside trees
offering rewards for the retrieval of lost family and friends from
the bowels of the forest
The Rivers, Canals, and Lakes
The many rivers spilling from the glacial lakes and waterfalls
of the Grey Mountains down to the Reik are central to the
Reikland’s economic success Barges brimful with merchandise
navigate the largest of these rivers, bringing diverse goods to the
capital of Altdorf, many of which are then shipped elsewhere in
the Empire or sold down the river to Marienburg
To further support the Reikland’s wide-ranging mercantile
ambitions, the richer noble and merchant houses invest in
extensive canals planned and constructed by Altdorf ’s famous
engineers The impact of these impressive waterways is
undeniable, with trade goods moving faster than ever before,
but they require maintenance and protection, both of which are
costly To ensure the wreckers and river pirates the canals attract
have minimal impact, road wardens, guards, and riverwardens are
employed as required, but frequently these are little better than
the criminals they purportedly thwart
The Reik
The Reik carries more traffic and trade than all the other rivers
in the Old World combined Indeed, so massive is the river
that almost half the fresh water of the Old World flows down
its length, for it not only drains all the Reikland with its many
tributaries, but most of the Empire beyond By the time the Reik
flows into the Reikland, it is already so wide it frequently appears
more lake than river, leaving it impossible to bridge using standard
engineering methods As this immense watercourse approaches
Altdorf to meet the dark waters of the Talabec, both rivers split
into a complex network of channels that spread outwards to form
the foggy Altdorf Flats Many of the thinner distributaries caused
by this are bridgeable, ensuring Altdorf is a natural centre for trade
as it is the only place where the Reik can be crossed on foot for
many hundreds of miles This single fact has secured Altdorf ’s
dominance of the area, both militarily and fiscally
Beyond the Altdorf Flats, the boggy channels reconverge and the
Reik begins its long journey westwards to the sea By this point,
it is so wide the opposite bank sometimes slips into mist, and
is so deep that even the largest sea-faring vessel can navigate
without fear Resultingly, warships of the Imperial Navy, some
so large to have crews out-numbering the populations of
smaller towns, not only patrol these waters, but are built there,
most launching from the Reiksport, a deep-water harbour built
on the shores of Altdorf Rocky islands are common in this
last stretch, most of which are secured with ancient fortresses,
overridden by river pirates, or abandoned completely, boasting
nothing more than a handful of old smugglers’ coves
The Bögen
The people of Bögenhafen claim Bögenauer, their town’s patron
deity, is responsible for the commerce-blessed state of the Bögen
A relatively placid river with a clear, smooth, but not overly swift
flow, the Bögen readily allows traffic to sail upriver nearly as
easily as down Its great depth allows larger river going vessels to
navigate safely from the Reik all the way to Bögenhafen Though
its source lies deep in the freezing peaks of the Grey Mountains,
the Bögen turns warm as it flows through the hilly Vorbergland,
which frequently causes heavy mists to gather along its banks
Most evenings, fingers of roiling fog rise from the Bögen,
wrapping tendrils about nearby settlements and the surrounding
Reikwald This is frequently thick enough to obscure vision, so
thieves, smugglers, and worse use it to conceal their nocturnal
activities

The Grünberg Canal
The Grünberg canal is a recent addition to the waterways of
the Reikland Commissioned by Emperor Luitpold III as part
of an extensive dowry paid to the previous Baron of Grünburg,
it was completed in 2506IC and has seen heavy use ever since
The canal bypasses the treacherous shallows of the Reiker Marshes
overlooked by Castle Reikguard, and it now takes much of the
river Teufel’s barge traffic heading for Altdorf Grünburg’s walls
protect the tollhouse on the south end of the canal, and any barge
wishing to pass it must pay a tax based on the length of the vessel
entering the canal system Queues are common at first light and
dusk, but otherwise the tollhouse sees infrequent business At the
north end there is a lock-keeper’s house on the outskirts of Prieze
that doubles as a barracks and stables for the twelve road wardens
paid to patrol the canal path and help any barges as required This
help typically comes in the form of impromptu protection taxes,
which if not paid leave the offending barge open to bandit attacks
Attacks that inevitably follow for any who refuse to pay
The Teufel
The Teufel flows down from the mountains to Ubersreik, then
northwards to the Reik through Auerswald and Grünburg Its
waters have a distinctly reddish hue caused by iron deposits in
the mud and silt, though storytellers suggest it’s the unending
wars between the Grey Mountain Dwarfs and Goblins that
have permanently stained the river red A great deal of rain
feeds into the Teufel and it regularly overflows, especially in
spring, frequently flooding its mud-filled waters deep into the
surrounding forest Inns — often built high to avoid floodwater
— are common along the Teufel, as are bandits, since much of the
river runs through the Reikwald Road wardens regularly patrol
the banks of the Teufel and they are not fond of any that linger
without good reason
The Vorbergland Canals
The Vorbergland Canals are an engineering marvel
Commissioned by the previous Archduke of Upper Teufel in
conjunction with merchant houses from Nuln and Marienburg,
the canals are the pride of the south, carrying trade from
Wissenland across the Vorbergland and back again Comprised
of five canals connecting five major tributaries of the Reik, the
system links Nuln through to Carroburg, skipping the high
taxes of Altdorf completely
Recently, the Dwarfs of Karak Azgaraz sent delegations to
the lords of Suden Vorbergland demanding the canals be shut,
claiming old treaties from centuries past were being broken by
an unacceptably large display of shoddy workmanship This has
caused an uproar from graduates of the Imperial Engineers’
School who see the steam locks and clever water-pumps as a
pinnacle of human engineering
The Weissbruck Canal
Connecting the Bögen and Reik rivers — bypassing Middenland’s
Carroburg taxes in the process — the Weissbruck canal sees
steady traffic year-round as trade flows to and from Altdorf A
toll to use the canal is paid once at whatever end a vessel enters
The canal is 25-feet wide, with frequent berthing points and
numerous places to stay along its length
Local bargees do not readily discuss it with strangers, but there
are many unusual stories whispered about the canal Supposedly,
the Dwarf engineers that designed it unearthed pre-Unberogen
artefacts when they first dug the waterway, and things have
never been right in the area since Some even swear that should
Morrsleib — the smaller of the two moons — be full, one can sail
the canal north to somewhere other than the Reik…
X
The Cursed and Fetid Marshlands
Although Middenland to the north claims many famous
marshlands — such as the Furdienst, Midden Marshes, and
Shadensumpf — the river banks of the Reikland are no less
waterlogged, frequently giving way to fens, mires, and dangerous
mud plains, especially down the length of mighty River Reik The
largest of these is the Grootscher Marsh on the border with the
Wasteland, but many other examples exist, such as the Altdorf
Flats, the Reiker Marshes, and the Uhland Bogs
Grootscher Marsh
The largest wetland of the Reikland, the Grootscher Marsh
spreads out on both banks of the Reik It extends some fifty miles
into the Reikland and Middenland from the border with the
Wasteland, and is considered by many to be a cursed place, for
it is the site of one of the Empire’s most famous military defeats
of the last century: The Battle of Grootscher Marsh, where the
Wasteland secured its independence from imperial rule
In modern times, the Grootscher Marsh remains the foulsmelling
fenland it always was, filled with ill-sounding birds and
infested with River Trolls In leaner years, when meat cannot
be found for their rotting larders, the Trolls grow hungry and
rumour holds they slip into the Reik to pluck the unwary from
passing ships Being sent to clear out the Grootscher Marsh is
considered one of the worst punishment details imaginable by
the State Armies of the Reikland; even the hardiest soldiers
hesitate when ordered there
Travellers on the Reik occasionally report the sounds of strange,
ominous horns echoing through the thick fogs that frequently
coalesce across the marsh, and wise locals note Trolls don’t make
use of such Old hands on the Reik agree, and then swiftly change
the subject…
Shroom Boom
Physicians, apothecaries, and scholars all pay high prices for
the multitude of rare mushrooms and unusual plants that
only grow in the perilous Cursed Marsh about the city of
Marienburg However, several crops of Daemon’s Tand, Rood
Puffball, and Dodeshors Polypore, three of the most valuable
Wastelander fungi, have recently been discovered growing in
the murk of the Grootscher Marsh Sensing heavy profits,
Klaes Adaans, an ever-frowning merchant lodging in the village
of Oberseert overlooking the marsh, is hiring mushroompickers
willing to brave the wetlands This brings increased
activity that not only attracts hungry River Trolls to the area,
but also Goblins keen to capture them Klaes cares little for
such trivialities, and certainly won’t mention them; all he wants
is a steady crop of lucrative fungus Those with stern hearts
and keen eyes can reap real rewards here… or become meat
for a Troll’s larder
Altdorf Flats
The rivers Reik and Talabec split around the city of Altdorf
into hundreds of shifting channels, black-soiled mudflats, and
marshes that spread north and south of the great city Known as
the Altdorf Flats, these wide wetlands are dominated by rushes
and reeds, and are notorious for their foul stench and slurping,
River-Troll-infested bogs Some twenty miles west of Altdorf, the
snaking channels converge again into the wide River Reik, where
the waters flow further westwards to the Princedom of Carroburg
The flats are crossed by six primary causeways that fan from
the fertile farmlands immediately surrounding Altdorf Each
causeway is punctuated by several stone bridges, some of which
are Dwarf-wrought and date from the Time of Sigmar Their
roads are ever-busy with coaches and merchant trains coming to
and from the capital, so are heavily patrolled by road wardens
Similarly, the marshy waterways are a haven for smugglers looking
to circumvent Altdorf ’s heavy tolls and taxes, so riverwarden and
Shipswords are a frequent sight plying the unsure waters, seeking
criminals and driving back larger marsh monsters
Reiker Marshes
Lying between the Reiker Heights and the Hohesesienen Hills
at the sluggish confluence of the River Reik and the River
Teufel, the Reiker Marshes are notoriously treacherous, and
inexperienced captains frequently run aground in its deceptively
shallow waters Tattered flags and corroded signposts mark
the most perilous sections, but these are woefully insufficient
River guides locally known as ‘huffers’ are available to guide
boats through the waters for a reasonable price, most of whom
gather in the towns of Prieze and Babenborn on the Reik, and
in significantly fewer numbers in Buxhead on the Teufel The
waters are at their most dangerous in the five-mile stretch at
the end of the Teufel where it meets the Reik Locally called
‘Leopold’s Folly’ after the emperor who tried, and failed, many
times to dredge the red-silted waters in order to make it safe
for deep-drafted ships, wise barge captains avoid it completely,
preferring to pay tolls to pass through the Grünberg Canal
rather than risk their crew and cargo
Uhland Bogs
A windswept peatland lying to the south of the County of the
West March, the mossy Uhland Bogs are pierced through by
the Westerfluss, the river that forms the natural border between
the Wasteland and the Reikland Towers of peat cut from the bog
can be found stacked in the small villages near the mire, where
dried blocks are used to fuel local fires in winter or shipped
downriver to be sold along the Reik In the south-west depths of
the bog a number of ancient, carved stones rise from the sodden
land, drawing local cultists of Rhya and older deities to worship
during important equinoxes One group of these stones, called the
Crowstones, has a particularly foul reputation, and the surrounding
bog is permanently blackened Locals warn never to travel to the
stones near the festival days of Geheimistag or Hexenstag, for they
claim crows gather in impossible numbers and unspeakable things
rise from the bog to wreak terror upon the living

Politics
The Reikland perceives itself as a progressive, civilised realm,
standing apart from the backward barbarity of the other provinces
It is ruled by an Elector Count bearing the title ‘Grand Prince
of the Reikland’ — the ‘grand’ appellation indicating the prince
is an elector for the next emperor when the current one dies The
grand prince’s land is divided into a patchwork of individual fiefs
governed by dukes, counts, margraves, high priests, abbots and
other rulers These provinces, whose lords swear directly to the
grand prince, are collectively titled the ‘Reikland Estates’, most
of which have been ruled by the same families or institutions
for uncounted generations, affording them significant influence
The grand prince’s decrees are ratified by the ‘Reikland Diet’, an
assembly comprised of the lords of the Reikland Estates However,
certain powers were reserved for the crown during Magnus the
Pious’s Imperial Reforms two centuries ago, including: the right
to summon and command the State Army of the Reikland, the
raising of emergency taxes in times of crisis, the right to authorise
new coinage, and the right to call a High Lord Steward’s Court
should a powerful noble be charged with a crime
Reikland Council
The day-to-day business of ruling the province is handled by
the Reikland Council, which comprises ten ‘High Lords’ The
council meets weekly in the Wilhelm Chamber of the Volkshalle
in Altdorf to discuss matters of import It is rare for more than six
of the high lords to attend simultaneously, and almost unheard of
for the prince to attend in person
The High Lords of the Reikland
The Ten High Lords of the Council of the Reikland, are appointed
by the grand prince Whilst most commoners could never hope
to encounter such luminaries, their agents and representatives can
be found everywhere
High Lord of the Chair
A close advisor to the grand prince, the High Lord of the Chair
officially leads the Reikland Council in the elector count’s stead
The current High Lord of the Chair, the stoic Graf Archibold
von Lilahalle, was granted the influential position after being
gravely wounded whilst saving the life of Emperor Luitpold III
from an assassin’s blade Lingering, painful injuries confine him
to a steam-driven wheelchair; an irony only the unwise note
aloud
High Lord Steward
The High Lord Steward is the only man legally allowed to judge
a crime committed by the lord of a Reikland Estate As a High
Lord Stewart’s Court is rarely called — most lords being simply
too powerful to call to task — the position is largely ceremonial
Nevertheless, the High Lord Steward is arguably the most senior
High Lord, and often stands in for the Grand Prince when he is
unable — or unwilling — to attend court
The current High Lord Steward is Archduke Adelbert von
Bögenberg, a quiet man with little experience of the law, but a
shrewd understanding of people As much of the grand prince’s
time is taken up with imperial matters, he is arguably the  de
facto ruler of the Reikland, much to the High Lord of the Chair’s
chagrin
High Lord Treasurer
The High Lord Treasurer is responsible for the Reikland’s
treasury and for raising revenues The position is extraordinarily
important and is almost always held by a close ally of the crown
The current High Lord Treasurer is the aging genius Grafina
Elena von Midwald, a dear friend of the previous grand prince,
well known for her outspoken appreciation of fine wine and fine
men
X
High Lord Ambassador
The High Lord Ambassador organises the Reikland’s foreign
relations and runs the Altdorf Black Chamber: the infamous
spies of the Reikland
Graf Liepmund Holzkrug, the current High Lord Ambassador,
is an intense, fiercely ambitious man, whose family are strong
rivals to House Holswig-Schliestein in Altdorf He is known for
his vindictive nature, his ruthless politics, and his love of hunting
rare and exotic game
High Lord Judge
The High Lord Judge is the ultimate voice on all Reiklander Law,
which is quite different from Imperial Law
The current High Lord Judge of the Reikland also serves as
Supreme Law Lord of the Empire: Lector Agatha von Böhrn
of Verena She is experienced in all legal matters, and widely
regarded as one of the most intelligent people in the Empire,
especially by those who have bribed her
High Lord Chancellor
The High Lord Chancellor is the crown’s spiritual advisor, and
oversees the Reikland Chancery and the Silver Seal
The current High Lord Chancellor is High Priestess Halma
Habermann of Sigmar, a robust woman with a pale complexion,
rosy cheeks, and thick limbs Though generally charming and
approachable, she is zealously out-spoken in her opposition
to the Colleges of Magic, and rumours abound regarding the
atrocities she witnessed during her service in the Order of the
Silver Hammer  
High Lord Chamberlain
The High Lord Chamberlain runs the Palace of Altdorf and the
adjoining Volkshall The position is arguably one of the most
influential in the Reikland, as most high-level imperial politics take
place within the chamberlain’s domain
The current High Lord Chamberlain is rake-thin Duchess Elze
von Skaag, an astute negotiator and careful planner who publicly
supports Emperor Karl-Franz in all matters Elze’s husband,
Duke Alardus von Skaag, is said to be deeply frustrated at his
wife residing in Altdorf and not in Skaggerdorf with him; by
comparison, it seems to suit her perfectly as most evenings she
can be found carousing through the city with her bodyguards
High Lord Reiksmarshal
The High Lord Reiksmarshal is responsible for leading the
armies of the Reikland, and ensuring each of the Reikland State
Regiments is raised, financed, and made available to the crown
as required
The current Reiksmarshal is the veteran general Duke Kurt
Helborg, close friend and tutor to the current grand prince —
Emperor Karl-Franz — and said to be the finest swordsman
in the Empire Helborg’s military commitments ensure that he
rarely takes his seat on the council, a circumstance that suits his
natural inclination
High Lord Constable
The High Lord Constable is the ultimate authority on the
genealogy and heraldry of the Reikland
The current High Lord Constable is smiling Grafina Matrella
von Achern, a woman with no interest in genealogy, but a
voracious appetite for political intrigue She has made the most of
this relatively inconsequential position, by chairing several private
councils on the Grand Prince’s behalf It is hard to reconcile the
bubbly, maternal demeanour she projects, and her reputation
amongst her peers as the most ruthless woman in the Reikland
High Lord Admiral
The High Lord Admiral is responsible for the Admiralty of the
Reik, and thus the entire Reikland navy
The current High Lord Admiral is the venerable Sea Lord
Adalmann von Hopfberg The Sea Lord — who is now quite
senile — took residency in the Great Hospice some fifteen
years ago, and the Admiralty has governed the navy without his
influence — or interference — since then
The Reikland Diet
The Reikland Diet, which meets as required in the Holzkrug
Chamber of the Volkshall in Altdorf, is responsible for
scrutinising decrees issued by the Grand Prince of Reikland,
either passing them or returning them to the crown with
suggested amendments
As most lords of the Reikland Estates don’t have time to attend
the diet themselves, they generally send favoured children,
spouses, relatives, or minions in their place, although decrees of
significant import will often bring worried lords from across the
Reikland to attend in person Given the number of agents the
Grand Prince of Reikland tasks to influence the Reikland Diet,
most votes are a formality
The Reikland Estates
The Reikland Estates are ruled by vassals of the Grand Prince
of Reikland  Their rulers can do as they will with their lands,
parcelling out fiefs to family and friends as they wish — though
the creation of new hereditary titles requires the approval of the
Prince of Reikland and the Reikland Diet
Each estate has a range of distinct legal and military obligations
to the crown, but all are required to build and maintain at least one
regiment for the Reikland State Army, soldiers typically used in
peacetime as watchmen, road wardens, or guards Most Reikland
Estates are feudal, comprised of smaller fiefs ruled by vassals, many
of whom hold hereditary titles that have existed for centuries
Glorious Reik l and X

Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Settlements
The Reikland prides itself as one of the most populated and
civilised of the Empire’s grand provinces Nevertheless, great
swathes of the realm are still wild, blanketed in forest and
untouched by Human hand Though these woodlands are
relatively safe when compared to the extraordinary dangers found
in the great forests elsewhere in the Empire, the darker corners
of the Reikwald are still home to all manner of terrible creatures
So, even after two thousand five hundred years of expansion,
most Reikland settlements are found along the Reik and its
many tributaries, connected by river if not always by road It is
only to the south of the Vorbergland, in the breadbasket of the
Reikland, that rural settlements spread freely, connected by wellmaintained
roads and remarkable canals
Altdorf and the Manifold Towns
It is said that all the roads and the rivers lead to Altdorf, the
largest, richest city of the Empire, but there are many other
interesting places to visit beyond that city’s high, white walls
Numerous towns, both large and small, can be found across
the Reikland, most acting as centres of trade or manufacture
A growing number of these flourishing centres of commerce
also hold the status of ‘freistadt’, meaning they are ‘free towns’:
granted charters to govern themselves, usually via a council of
burgomeisters with little or no interference from the local noble
houses
Altdorf
Emperor Karl-Franz I holds court in Altdorf, the capital of the
Reikland and the Empire as a whole It stands proudly at the
confluence of the mighty Reik and Talabec rivers, as well as at
Sample Reikland Estate
The Barony of Böhrn is a Reikland Estate of the Vorbergland ruled by House Böhrn for over four centuries Baroness Agetta holds
court in the town of Siedlung and currently has six vassals: three with hereditary titles — Baron Markham of Siebbach, Countess
Osterhild of Kaltenwald, and Baron Baltzer of Ettlindal — and three with non-hereditary titles, all of which were appointed by Agetta
personally — Warden Fabian of Ort, Warden Luethold of Koff, and Castellan Fronika of Neumarkt The three hereditary vassals have,
in turn, a total of seven vassals of their own
The Baroness does not attend the Reikland Diet; instead she relies on her influential younger sister, Lector Agatha von Böhrn, to watch
over it in her place Agatha resides in Altdorf serving as a member of the Imperial Council of State and the Reikland Council, as well
as tending to her duties as a Lector of Verena

the end of many major trade routes, and is easily the wealthiest
city in the Empire This ensures it is always expanding and
renewing, with fresh, wide-eyed hopefuls arriving daily, and
more commissions for new bridges, buildings, and engineering
marvels presented weekly to the city’s burgomeisters than most
cities consider in a year
Today, Altdorf is a city of steam-powered bridges, mismatched
islands, enormous tenements, and seemingly endless hordes of
people: one cannot traverse its crooked streets without becoming
intimately familiar with complete strangers Because it draws
merchants and diplomats from across the Known World, it is also
surprisingly cosmopolitan; not only do folk of all ranks, species,
creeds, and backgrounds rub shoulders freely, but even wizards
are a common sight, rarely receiving more hostility than a wary
glance or muttered blessing
Always surprising outsiders, a populous Elf quarter thrives near
the Reiksport — Altdorf ’s deep-water harbour and shipyard —
founded by High Elf merchant princes trading up the Reik from
Marienburg over a century ago The old alliance between the
Empire and Dwarfs has stood since Sigmar’s time and ensures
many Dwarf clans also reside there in tight-knit communities,
some having toiled on the city’s stonework for untold generations,
though naturally their stubborn natures preclude them from ever
calling Altdorf home There is even a healthy Halfling population,
with most earning their crusts serving fine food and better ales
in Altdorf ’s hostelries, many of which are guarded by the city’s
sizeable Ogre population Even odder creatures also call the city
home, with none more fantastic than those found in the Imperial
Zoo, which boasts myriad monsters and animals including the
Abomination of Stirland and the Drakwald Gibberbeast, each
caged and displayed for the amusement of all
This enormous and varied population helps secure one of
Altdorf ’s more notorious traits: it is infamously smelly, known
affectionately, and all too accurately, as ‘The Great Reek’ During
the hot, summer months the stench rolling in from the Altdorf
Flats grows so potent that many of the city’s wealthiest citizens
flee to country estates or the sumptuous, sun-kissed palaces of
Grenstadt in Southern Averland
The ever-present fetor does little to ease Altdorf ’s citizenry, a
mob known for being uniquely vocal and prone to rioting at
any imagined slight, especially if it involves new taxes Even
seemingly trivial actions of the local burgomeisters and nobles
can earn their ire; but the fact that many of their protests are
entirely fair does not lessen the crown’s fervour in quashing any
rebellious rabbles that may take to the streets
Altdorf is also a renowned centre for learning The sons and
daughters of wealthy households matriculate at the University of
Altdorf, often with little regard to academic ability; those with
scholarly potential, but without the financial clout to match it,
often find their way to the High Temple of Verena, for the Goddess
of Wisdom always has space for those blessed with intellect The
famed Imperial Engineers’ School — founded by Tilean genius
Leonardo da Miragliano — also lies within Altdorf ’s walls Here
some of the Empire’s bravest, and most reckless, souls devise new
and inventive methods for raining fiery death on the enemies of
mankind Perhaps unsurprisingly, the school has been rebuilt over
a dozen times since it was founded
Arguably the most significant educational institution in Altdorf
is also its most mysterious: The Colleges of Magic Founded over
two centuries ago at the behest of Emperor Magnus the Pious,
the colleges are guided by the principles and precepts of the elven
Loremaster Teclis The colleges are charged with training magically
gifted citizens to channel their dangerous talents in the defence
of the Empire Rumours of the warping influence of the potent
magical energies gathered by so many wizards living in such close
proximity persist; allegedly the very streets of the capital have been
twisted, and certain college buildings are believed to be hidden
from all but those few blessed — or should that be cursed — with
witchsight, but few believe such talk
Standing in stark contrast to the arcane mysteries of the Colleges
of Magic, and as a bulwark against any errant witches or rogue
magisters, Altdorf is also the beating heart of the Cult of Sigmar
Over two-thousand five-hundred years ago, Sigmar was born,
raised, and eventually crowned as first emperor within the
boundaries of modern Altdorf, and fittingly the city now boasts
more Sigmarite temples and holy sites than all the other cities
of the Empire combined Indeed, it is often said that one cannot
throw a heretic without hitting a temple of Sigmar in the city
’Special’ Delivery
A merchant is offering a ludicrously large fee to whomever will
deliver a package The catch is the package is bound for one of
the Colleges of Magic; the merchant claims to be terrified of
wizards To complicate matters, no-one actually knows where
the college in question — the Light College — can be found,
with some claiming that it exists ‘outside of normal space’ –
whatever that means The package is warm to the touch and
seems to vibrate faintly when pressed; just how desperate for
cash are the would-be messengers?
Auerswald
The lively town of Auerswald rises by the confluences of the
Teufel, Tranig, and Ober rivers, so is on one of the busiest — and
thus best patrolled — trade routes of the Reikland The folk of
Auerswald tend to be strong willed and determined, but their
easy charm and famous wit ensures no matter how steely their
negotiations, they rarely cause offence
The ruling graf, Ferdinand von Wallenstein, leaves the running
of Auerswald to a council of burgomeisters, far preferring his
luxurious palaces in Altdorf and Nuln to dirtying his hands

with direct rule His uncle, Lord Adelbert von Wallenstein, is
a grizzled but hale, old warhorse who spends most of his days
rooting out Goblins and bandits in the Reikwald to the east of
the town
Much of Auerswald is built on thick stilts over the floodplain
of the river Teufel, which is often in spate Connected
by a bewildering labyrinth of ramps, bridges and rope ladders,
outsiders can easily become lost More than one careless carouser
has fallen to a muddy death after over-indulging themselves in
the local taverns
In recent years, rumours have sprung up about an organised gang
of blackmailers and confidence tricksters operating from the
town, though no witnesses have lived long enough to testify to
their existence
Bögenhafen
The largest and most prosperous of all the Vorbergland’s market
towns, Bögenhafen lies in the very heart of the Reikland and
serves as the crossroads of the grand province Lying equidistant
between the capitals of Altdorf and Monfort, it is a crucial stop
on the principle trade route between The Empire and Bretonnia
Goods from Bretonnia and the four corners of the Empire are
traded here for local lumber, wool, and metals shipped down from
the Grey Mountains
Bögenhafen is located in Graf Wilhelm von Saponatheim’s
duchy, but he is quite content to let the town be run by a local
council — whose membership is dominated by members of
the local Merchants’ Guild, as well as representatives from the
Stevedores and Teamsters’ Guild — so long as they keep the
money flowing his way As goods coming north are transferred
from wagon to barge in Bögenhafen, the city is always well
stocked with warehouses full to the brim of fine wines and
expensive, fragrant cheeses
Dirty Business
The citizens of Bögenhafen are justifiably proud of their
bustling town for many reasons, not least of which is their
extensive sewers that are well-maintained by the town’s
Masons’ Guild Pleasing local gangs of criminals, the privacy
of the sewer system has proven to be something of a boon to
smugglers looking to avoid the taxes, tariffs, and fees levied by
the guilds and nobles of the unknowing town above
The town watch regularly hires interested citizens to sweep the
sewers for miscreants and ne’er-do-wells; of course, criminal
gangs aren’t the only danger that might be found lurking
beneath Bögenhafen…
Diesdorf
One of many towns lying on the River Reik between Altdorf
and Nuln, Diesdorf and its surrounding villages are dedicated
to the production of corn, which is mostly traded downriver to
the capital The town’s reliance on a single crop does mean that
should a blight cause the corn to die off, the town itself may
follow However, those who visit Diesdorf may conclude that its
chief export is, in truth, religious fervour Magnus the Pious once
gave a legendarily powerful speech in the town after folk travelled
far and wide to hear him
Ever since, Diesdorf became a major pilgrimage site for devout
Sigmarites, and on holy days the town’s population is frequently
doubled Despite its relatively small size, Diesdorf has numerous
temples and shrines to Sigmar, and most families in the town

Dunkelberg
Southernmost of the Reikland’s major trade centres, the market
town of Dunkelberg stretches across several hills along the banks
of the River Grissen The older, richer portions of the town sit
high on the hills, giving the nobles, and the rising merchant class
wealthy enough to afford the oldest townhouses, a commanding
view of the surrounding countryside Despite its ever-increasing
size, travellers note Dunkelberg’s ‘rustic’ feel, with regular markets
clogging its winding streets There shoppers can purchase
livestock; local produce; several excellent, fruity wines produced
by the surrounding villages; and hand-crafted goods from across
the Suden Vorbergland Wide-ranging ‘bleachfields’ extend from
the town, where local linen is dyed white by the sun around crops
Dunkelberg’s position near the looming Grey Mountains and
the wild Graugrissen forest leads to regular raids by Goblin
tribes While the richer portions of the town are well fortified
and protected by a high, stone wall, the rest lack any significant
defences As such, the poorer citizenry have learned not to grow
too attached to their homes, belongings, or loved ones
Orphan White
Dunkelberg has an excess of orphans, the result of frequent
Goblin raids, diseases, and other unpleasant occurrences
Rather than leave them underfoot, the local duke has
established a number of orphanages to provide shelter and
sustenance for the children; however, to earn their keep, he
puts the orphans, clad in their distinctive white uniforms,
to work in the bleachfields Visitors to Dunkelberg may be
shocked to see so many urchins deployed as a labour force,
though the callous disregard many of the wealthy of the town
have developed toward orphan children is perhaps worse
Sister Alella, a local Shallyan priestess, has recently expressed
concern over the wellbeing of these urchins, even claiming
that a number of the children have vanished under suspicious
circumstances, and is looking for help to uncover the truth of
what’s really happening
Eilhart
Known and celebrated by wine drinkers throughout the Old
World, the vineyards around Eilhart produce the succulent
grapes, and thus the wine, that shares its name Eilhart is widely
considered one of the Reikland’s best white wines, valued not
just for its crisp, light flavour, but also for its famously mild
hangovers that grow no worse no matter how much of it was
quaffed the night before, or so Eilharters claim Recently, Eilhart
has recently also become famed in the Reikland, and as far afield
as Marienburg, for its sharp, acidic beers making use of fragrant
hops and local grain
Given the excellent quality of its alcoholic beverages, Eilhart
has become a popular destination for riverboat cruises, wherein
epicures travel to the town to sample its wares from the many
drinking houses, breweries, and vineyards on offer Some claim
the high number of visiting Bretonnians — drawn by the excellent
wine — may account for the locals’ recent enthusiasm for beer
Grünburg
Downriver from several major trading towns, Grünburg is no
stranger to trade goods bound for the Reik, but it is in riverboat
manufacture that Grünburg truly excels The town’s boatyards
are in constant operation, churning out the barges that keep the
Reikland’s trade afloat
The open fields to the south-east of Grünburg appear verdant
and peaceful, but are known locally as the Battle Plains It was
here, long ago, the ruthless advance of the fearsome Orc Warlord
Gorbad Ironclaw was finally stalled Uniquely in Imperial military
history, the Battle of Grünburg was almost entirely contested by
mounted troops on both sides This quirk of history has made
the Battle Plains a site of interest for archaeologists, antiquarians,
and grave robbers, all keen to excavate debris from beneath the
blood-soaked earth
Holthusen
Nestled along the River Schilder, Holthusen is a major point
on the trade route between Eilhart and Marienburg The town
primarily deals in wine and beer, and the barrels in which they are
stored The coopers of Holthusen are rightly renowned for their
sturdy barrels, most famously the Holthusen Hogshead, allegedly
stout enough to withstand direct cannon fire, while leaving the
precious drink within unscathed The majority of the vintners
and brewers of the western Vorbergland use Holthusen barrels;
indeed, many age their stock here in specialised warehouses sunk
deep into the ground to keep them cool
Holthusen is enclosed in several rings of tall palisades and the
folk of the town are frequently on edge, for while few bandits
would dare to menace the town, wild Beastmen living deep in the
nearby Reikwald regularly attack without warning before melting
back into the forest Many citizens believe that the creatures have
an insatiable thirst for wine, though some fear blood is their
tipple of choice Whatever the case, the town has taken to leaving
barrels of cheap wine at the outskirts of the surrounding forest in
the hopes the beasts will take their offerings and leave in peace
Of course, should any Witch Hunters hear of this appeasement,
there will likely be a reckoning…

The Rime Tree
In a clearing a few miles to the north-east of Holthusen stands
a tree unique in all the Reikwald: a magnificent pine locked in
ice all year round The Rime Tree, as it is called, never melts,
and sends constant flurries of ice and snow cascading down
onto the frosty undergrowth below The tree is freezing to the
touch and even the mightiest axe blows barely crack the thick
ice coating its bark
The site has been claimed by the Cult of Ulric, and is the
major terminus for devout Ulricans on pilgrimages south of
the Reik For those of an arcane bent, the perpetually icy
bark of the tree has certain useful – and therefore valuable
– magical properties But Ulricans are rarely happy to have
wizards poking about their sacred sites, so obtaining some of
the bark safely is something of a risky endeavour Therefore,
Lord Magister Schlotter of the Bright Order is willing to pay
good coin for brave men to secure what he cannot
Kemperbad
An ancient town with a long and convoluted history, the Grand
Freistadt of Kemperbad is known and celebrated for producing
the finest brandy in the Reikland Though part of the Reikland,
Kemperbad lies on the eastern bank of the Reik; historically
the town has been fought over, and ruled by, nobles from
Talabecland, Stirland, and the Reikland, changing hands time
and again through a series of marriages, treaties, and wars Since
gaining a charter affording it the right to self-rule in 1066IC
from Boris Goldgather, Kemberbad has been a Freistadt led by
a local council
Its prime location on the river, coupled with the ability to impose
and retain its own taxes, has made the town very rich indeed
Because of this, the merchants of Kemperbad are legendarily
ostentatious, dressing in outfits so gaudy as to shame a peacock,
and costly enough to beggar folk of more modest means
Unsurprisingly, the neighbouring nobility regard Kemperbad’s
coffers with envious eyes, and some send agents to destabilise the
town
Schädelheim
Sitting near the Grootscher Marsh at the confluence of the
River Mos with the Reik, Schädelheim makes the most it can
of its lucrative position on the trade route between Marienburg
and Altdorf, boasting a high number of inns and berths for
passing ships and barges Ferries here regularly run travellers
back and forth over both rivers, and it is a hub for the disparate
communities of the nearby marshlands
Just south of the centre of the town lies an ancient temple
dedicated to Morr, the God of Death The grand, crumbling
building has presided over Schädelheim since its infancy, possibly
even predating the town’s founding Because of this, many of the
locals have an especially strong affinity with Morr, a situation
rarely seen in the Empire outside Ostermark, and highly unusual
for the strongly Sigmarite Reikland This is something local
Sigmarites are keen to rectify
Schilderheim
Standing proud at the confluence of the Schilder and Reik
rivers, Schilderheim is one of the Reikland’s most important
trading towns It is also home to a surprisingly diverse array of
wildfowl, particularly wading birds Most notable is the red crane,
a sedentary river bird found predominantly on the Reik that is
known for using heavy stones to crack open river clams
Though already a prosperous town, the Merchants’ Guild and
burgomeisters of Schilderheim have grander aspirations, eyeing
the wealth of Altdorf and Marienburg enviously Wanting their
piece of this pie, the local stevedore guild has recently raised
its prices, a highly unpopular move that has brought much
dissatisfaction, some of which has spilled into the streets To
avoid this extra fee, a number of merchants have occasionally
sought to bypass the stevedores altogether, conducting their
business on the river itself, swapping not just stock, but whole
barges Merchant houses connected to this practice have recently
found wharves set alight, warehouses raided, and barges sunk;
of course, the Stevedores claim it has nothing to do with their
honourable members The Merchants’ Guild, in turn, is willing to
pay a lot of money to any who can prove it is
Stimmigen
The major bridge over the River Ober, coupled with access
to the Vorbergland canal system, ensures a great deal of trade
passes through Stimmigen on its way to Ubersreik, making it
one of the busiest market towns in the Suden Vorbergland
It is widely famed for its lush orchards, and is the source of
the Reikland’s best known apple, the sweet, yet tart, Ernwald
The Ernwald only flourishes in Stimmigen’s environs, proving
resistant to attempts to cultivate it elsewhere in the Empire
In addition to curious horticulturists and jealous farmers, the
Ernwald has attracted a significant Halfling population to the
area, whose delicious apple pies, pastries and crumbles — not
to mention crisp cider — can be found in most local hostelries
all year round, and especially during Pie Week at the start of
autumn This Halfling festival is celebrated by all in Stimmigen,
an opportunity for rich and poor alike to enjoy tastings and
eating competitions, and generally gorge themselves on all
manner of sweet, baked goods
Ubersreik
The town of Ubersreik is situated near Grey Lady Pass, one of
only two major passes over the Grey Mountains into Bretonnia
Because of this, the town regularly sees traders and travellers from
across the Old World The mighty fortress known as the Black
Rock is connected to the walls of the town should any less welcome
travellers attempt ingress Ubersreik has had a long association
X
282
with the nearby Dwarven clans of the Grey Mountains, and in a
situation unique to Ubersreik, representatives of the city’s Dwarf
population sit on the town council One of Ubersreik’s more
famous edifices, its spectacular bridge over the River Teufel, was
built by Dwarfs during the time of Magnus the Pious Widely
regarded as one of the most impressive feats of engineering to be
found in the Reikland, it connects the trade road which runs all
the way from Bögenhafen to Dunkelberg then Nuln Ubersreik
deals in trade of all kinds, but is most well-known for ore and the
skilled metal-work of the Dwarfs
For exhaustive details on Ubersreik, see the WFRP Starter Set
Weissbruck
Originally little more than one of many tiny fishing villages
along the River Bögen, Weissbruck has in the past century
grown rapidly into a bustling port for goods and travellers
moving between Bögenhafen and Altdorf Weissbruck’s change
in fortune is due to its shrewd rulers, the Grubers, who decided
to capitalise on the rich deposits of coal and iron found in the
Skaag Hills This ready supply of much needed resources enabled
the Grubers, with the permission and partnership of the Prince
of Altdorf, to commission Dwarf engineers to construct a canal
in 2462IC, which rapidly accelerated the town’s growth, bringing
all manner of citizenry with it
While the output of the mines has slowed in recent years, trade
has steadily increased Despite its rulers’ riches, Weissbruck
retains something of the character of a typical mining town;
burly miners and dockworkers ensure an uneasy peace, and the
threat of violence is never far removed As the mines’ output has
diminished, more and more miners have descended from the
Skaag hills, a growing, agitated, unemployed workforce with little
to do but drink cheap rotgut and scowl at strangers
Wheburg
Wheburg is the first town encountered after leaving the Grey
Mountains on the road from Helmgart to Bögenhafen Its
proximity to the fortress of Helmgart ensures troops pass through
regularly, and the town offers a sizeable barracks for visiting
soldiers Having survived the mountains’ extreme weather —
to say nothing of ravaging armies of Orcs and Goblins, and
potential monsters roosting on the nearby Drachenberg — most
visitors arrive to Wheburg with a powerful desire to celebrate life
To accommodate that need, Wheburg has become renowned for
its hospitality, and its locals are widely regarded as the friendliest
in the Reikland — for a price The streets are lined with taverns,
inns, and gambling dens, not to mention some less salubrious
establishments where all the pleasures of the flesh are purveyed,
and illicit substances may be procured Though fist-fights and
petty crime are common, things rarely get too out of hand given
the significant number of soldiers usually on hand to disperse
any rowdy revellers (except, of course, when those revellers are,
themselves, off-duty soldiers) Spending time in Wheburg prior
to marriage has become something of a rite-of-passage for wellheeled
Reiklanders, and it’s common to hear men and women
calling out, ‘what happens in Wheburg, stays in Wheburg!’ from
many a street corner
The Bastions and Fortresses
The Reikland’s southern border is dominated by the Grey
Mountains, which are, in turn, dominated by a series of
Glorious Reik l and X
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
strongholds, built and rebuilt to defend against raiding Mountain
Trolls, Greenskins, and the restless dead, not to mention the
neighbouring kingdom of Bretonnia
The River Reik is similarly littered with bastions to ward attack,
but there most are stony relics of the Empire’s broken past when
the Reikland warred with the other grand provinces and itself
Only strategic fortresses now remain, easily outnumbered by
castles fallen to disrepair, their ancient strength and storied past
all but forgotten, just as their crumbling stonework is lost to time
and decay
Blackstone Tower
While the Axe Bite and Grey Lady passes are the best-known
routes over the Grey Mountains, they are not the only ways
through the range The Crooked Corridor is a narrow gorge
through the mountains not far from the border with the
Wasteland It is useless to most merchants, being far too tight
for wagons or horses, and dangerous to boot as much of the path
is perched precariously on the edge of steep cliffs, meaning the
slightest slip of a foot could lead to a painfully inglorious end
Completely impassable in the winter and perilous at all other
times, the Crooked Corridor was known only to goat herders and
smugglers until a spate of Greenskin raids brought the pass to the
attention of the authorities
Several decades ago, Emperor Mattheus II ordered the
construction of a fortress to watch over the Crooked Corridor
after repeated invasion Nine years later, Blackstone Tower was
completed, drawing its name from the locally quarried dark stone
that forms its walls, and the slate that tops its towers
Its position high above the Crooked Corridor offered the
Emperor’s sharpshooters an excellent perch from which to employ
their lethal skills; however, its status as a Reiklander bastion
was short-lived An oversight at the planning stage resulted in
the tower being built on lands claimed by the Dwarfs of Karak
Ziflin Not wanting to upset the Dwarfs, the Emperor ceded the
tower, much to the annoyance of the Margrave of Geetburg who
had helped finance it
Today, the Dwarfs ‘generously’ allow a limited garrison to
barrack alongside their own troops at Blackstone Tower, a
largely rebuilt structure With the Reiklanders chafing under
the Dwarfs’ leadership, and the Dwarfs constantly belittling the
shoddy human stonework they’ve yet to replace, the Tower is a
powderkeg of grievances and resentment, generating a tense —
and some would say unsustainable — atmosphere
Steirlich Manor
On the southern slopes of the Hägercrybs, in the Duchy of
Grauwerk, sits a heavily fortified manor atop a windswept
ridge The manor is ancient, a holding of the von Bruner family,
and currently ruled by Graf Steirlich: both the Graf and his
imposing manor were named for a famous ancestor who was
gifted the land by Emperor Mandred Ratslayer in 1138IC
The Graf is steely eyed and ambitious, with a ruthless streak as
wide as the Reik He is well thought of amidst the local smallfolk
for his determination to root out bandits and hunt down other
menaces that would dare impinge upon his property Indeed,
there are whisperings that he may be a little too willing to
investigate unnatural occurrences, for dark rumours of corruption
swirl around the scions of the von Bruner line
Certainly, the darkly handsome Graf is always on the lookout
for stout hearts, stern wills, and strong sword-arms to help him
maintain the peace, so few air their fears aloud
X
Helmgart
Set high in the Grey Mountains, the fortress town of Helmgart
guards the border with Bretonnia from the eastern side of Axe
Bite Pass The Empire’s relations with Bretonnia have not always
been civil, and while the ramparts of Helmgart are no longer lined
with aging skulls in elaborate helms, they most likely remain in
the castle’s cellars These days, the soldiers of Helmgart are more
often called upon to patrol the pass, protecting travellers and
merchants from Greenskins, bandits, and other menaces
Helmgart’s keep was carved directly out of the mountainside
by Dwarfs long ago Three tiers of stout stone walls buttress a
great granite mountain, dominating the surrounding terrain and
offering an excellent view of the road below Adjoining Helmgart
proper, is a huge, imposing wall broken only by a single, long
tunnel standing between the two, sheer mountainsides: the only
route through to Bretonnia Amongst the troops garrisoning
the fortress are a number of storied regiments Most famously,
the gunners of Mackensen’s Marauders – a Reiklander State
Regiment – are well known for their deadly accuracy, a fearsome
reputation perhaps aided by the lack of cover on the road below
the high walls The fortress sits at one end of the great road that
leads directly to Bögenhafen, and from there onto Altdorf
As guardian of the principle trade route into the Empire from
Bretonnia, Helmgart is equal parts imposing citadel and bustling
trade town Here, Bretonnian merchants barter brandy, wine, fine
fabrics, arms, and armour, while their Reiklander counterparts in
turn funnel their province’s goods south The local Dwarf clans,
too, trade ingots of silver, lead, and iron, along with precious
pieces of Dwarf-smithed metalwork With so many merchants
and traders, the Marketplatz of Helmgart is a bustling place, rife
with endless opportunities and uncounted thieves
The Stone
Towering over one of the many islands in the Reik by Essel, the
massive promontory known simply as The Stone can be seen for
miles around A winding path coils up the steep, craggy face from
the small, seemingly insignificant jetty at its base to the severe
walls of the squat citadel crowning the rocky mount Captains
give it a wide berth when they pass, the more superstitious
among them making an offering of salt and steel to Grandfather
Reik to safeguard their passage No pennants fly atop the grim
battlements, though the occasional gleam from a guard’s helmet
attests to the troops patrolling the ramparts
Unknown to most, the Stone is a secure prison containing
dangerous criminals that, for various sensitive, political reasons
cannot simply be executed Some have powerful friends and
family, or are themselves nobles whose crimes, if publicly
acknowledged would cause scandal and shame to the great and
good of the Reikland Others are political hostages, held to
ensure the compliance of wayward relatives And, of course, a few
simply know too much, their precious secrets safeguarded in The
Stone against their future need No-one really knows about the
conditions within The Stone’s walls; no-one really wants to ask
The Villages, Hamlets, and Holy Places
Throughout the Reikland, most of the uncounted hundreds of
villages and hamlets are clustered close to towns for protection
and trade By comparison, in the open Suden Vorbergland,
settlements are strewn more freely amongst the farmlands,
dotting the landscape every few miles or so, relying on the
protection of fortresses in the mountains and the state regiments
from the large market towns Due to a quirk in Reikland law
installed by Sigmarites many centuries ago, villages are defined
as any small settlement including a temple of Sigmar; hamlets,
by comparison, are those without such spiritual support, and are
often smaller because of this
Besides these smaller settlements, the Reikland hosts an
uncounted number of isolated monasteries, abbeys, way-temples,
and other holy sites While most are sited in locations not too far
from protection, some well-fortified examples can be found in
the most unlikely places, often for religious or historical reasons,
be that upon the sides of a mountain, the depths of a forest, the
centre of a lake, or in an even less likely location
Monastery of the Holy Word
Deep in the Reikwald west of Altdorf, far from any easily traversed
road, lies the Monastery of the Holy Word This hallowed site is
tended by the Sigmarite Order of the Anvil The Order of the
Anvil is responsible for keeping the laws that govern the Cult of
Sigmar and maintaining all details of the cult’s practices
The Monastery of the Holy Word houses the order’s greatest
treasure: the Testaments of Sigmar Collected not long after
Sigmar abdicated, the Testaments are a gathering of the
written memories of warriors and citizens who knew Sigmar
Heldenhammer before he ascended to godhood Considered to
be the most accurate collection of the things Sigmar actually said
and the practices he maintained in life, the Testaments are some
of the holiest works in the Reikland
It is not normally the practice of the Order of the Anvil to
accept visitors, but the Monastery of the Holy Word is no
normal monastery Penitents seeking obscure details about the
foundations of Sigmar’s Law will travel from across the Empire
to query the black and green robed monks on doctrine
Nobles and exceedingly wealthy merchants who have repeatedly
shown their devotion to the Cult of Sigmar will occasionally be
granted leave to take a pilgrimage to the Monastery of the Holy
Word While none are allowed to read the original Testaments, or
even to touch them, leave to gaze upon one or two of the original
pages is deemed to be a sacred honour beyond price
Rottfurt
Scores of settlements line the River Teufel, most easily
forgettable, even interchangeable Not so Rottfurt, whose name
is spoken of in hushed, reverential tones by scholars and wizards
throughout the Empire Though primarily a village of shepherds,
Glorious Reik l and X
285
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
producing wool and mutton, Rottfurt also produces a famous
— and famously pricy — sheepskin parchment: Rottfurt Silver
The parchment possesses a faint sheen, takes ink well, and resists
fading far longer than other, lesser parchments
Because of this, the thick-wooled, pale sheep of Rottfurt are
the village’s pride and afforded every comfort They feed on
the luscious grass of the nearby Hammastrat Heights and are
generally allowed to wander as they will during the day The
shepherds contribute to a rotating militia, tasked with protecting
their precious flocks at all costs
However, of late the livestock have been going missing;
intriguingly, those on guard have always found themselves falling
asleep, despite their best efforts On waking, another sheep has
vanished What began as a minor frustration has grown to a fullblown
obsession for the locals, with as many wild and spectacular
theories flying around as there are stars in the heavens
Wörlin
The small fishing hamlet of Wörlin is almost impossible to spot
from the river The settlement is surrounded by a number of
small, rocky islets and promontories, and sheltered by thousands
of bowing trees These ‘Willows of Wörlin’ line the banks of the
Reik for many miles around, and it seems none have any interest
in using their lumber A great deal of trade passes by Wörlin,
but very little actually happens in Wörlin as most of the passing
goods are bound for more lucrative markets
The Root of The Problem
On the festival day of Sonnstill, the ‘hamlet circle’ — a council
of the hamlet’s elders — gather to ‘Water the Willows’ This
simple ceremony involves singing, dancing, feasting, and the
slicing of a virile stranger’s throat, splashing blood across the
thirsty roots of the Queen Willow, quenching her sanguinary
appetites for one more year
Should the ceremony be completed, the Queen is pleased,
and will ensure the hamlet’s safety from the children of the
forest Should the ceremony be interrupted, the Queen awakes
and summons her children, bringing braying Beastmen by
the score to slaughter all in their path But outsiders rarely
consider such consequences when they have a knife to their
throat
Zahnstadt
Isolated Zahnstadt is considered by locals to be the ‘last village
of the Vorbergland’, after which the rolling hills turn barren and
cold before reaching upwards to the Greenskin-infested Grey
Mountains In the shadow of those peaks, Zahnstadt skulks along
the southern bank of the River Mos, deep in a dark valley with
bleak crags rising to all sides In summer, the sun only shines
on the village for an hour or two at midday, hiding behind the
surrounding cliffs in the morning, and creeping behind the
mountains as the day lengthens
In the winter, there is no direct sunlight at all, locking the
village in a gloomy cycle of twilight and darkness Despite this,
the folk of Zahnstadt are famous for their bright dispositions
and perpetual cheerfulness, a trait outsiders often find forced
and off-putting Every house in Zahnstadt is brightly painted in
a garish medley of different, often clashing colours Its homely
inn, the Wayward Sun, is famous for its ever-burning hearthfire
and for the relentlessly cheerful songs that echo long into the
night
The Sins of the Past
Zahnstadt has long been in the grip of something far worse
than a lack of enriching sunlight: vampires Near the End of the
Third Vampire Wars, Janos von Carstein deserted the vampire
lord Mannfred von Carstein’s depleted armies After weeks of
evading pursuit from his master’s vengeful minions, he chanced
upon dark Zahnstadt and realised it was the perfect place to go
to ground Almost three-hundred years later, and he hides there
still, and time has made him bold He now sleeps beneath the
Wayward Sun in an ostentatious, velvet-lined coffin, rising each
evening to hold ‘court’ in the inn, forcing enthralled locals to
sing happy songs of his homeland Sylvania
Rumour of this has not only reached the ears of Witch Hunters,
but also the pawns of recently resurrected Mannfred von
Carstein, who has ordered his traitorous son be brought before
him It would be unfortunate, indeed, should poor, unsuspecting
souls happen to hostel in the Wayward Sun on the same night
the Witch Hunters arrive to investigate, and the same night that
Mannfred’s agents choose to extract Janos before the Witch
Hunters uncover his true nature…
The Ancient Sites
and Terrible Ruins
The Reikland’s long and bloody history stretches back long
before the time of Magnus the Pious and the Great War Against
Chaos; relics of ancient atrocities litter the realm, and it is a
wise and wary traveller that checks for ancient standing stones
before erecting their camp of an evening Some of these sites bear
haunting legends of gruesome renown and macabre spectacle,
but most towns and villages boast their own local ruins, with
accompanying tales of horror and bloodshed
The Darkstone Ring
The wise do not venture to the Darkstone Ring The path to this
place of terrible and ancient power lies to the north of Blutroch
X
286
near the Altdorf-Bögenhafen road When night falls, the six
suggestively-carved stones glow green with a wan luminosity,
flaring bright as Morrslieb waxes
At the centre of the Darkstone Ring lies a monolithic slab of
unidentifiable rock, permanently stained with the blood of the
countless innocents sacrificed there down through the millennia
Despite the ring’s fell reputation, travellers seem drawn to its
malevolent environs, lured by legends of mystical potential and
lost artefacts of terrible arcane power Not even frequent sightings
of beastmen and cultists — especially around Geheimnisnacht —
can deter these brave, some may say foolhardy, souls
Castle Drachenfels
Like the twisted talon of a malformed claw, the seven towers of
Castle Drachenfels clutch at the sky in a gesture of malevolence
and spite Each of its misshapen turrets is festooned with
windows, resembling eyes without number, alert to the arrival of
any traveller unlucky — or unwise — enough to stumble upon
the lair of the Great Enchanter, Constant Drachenfels
Drachenfels — a mythically powerful sorcerer, necromancer,
and daemonologist — has tormented mankind since before the
time of the Empire; already ancient when he suffered his first
great defeat at the hands of Sigmar Heldenhammer, he has
returned time and again to his haunt in the Grey Mountains,
like a festering wound that refuses to heal Rumours abound that
the seemingly quiescent ruins, mostly reduced to rubble and long
forsaken, are less abandoned than they appear…
Helspire
Looming perilously in the peaks overlooking Axe-Bite Pass, the
Helspire is a grim fortress, carved directly out of the living rock of
the Grey Mountains and inlaid with the bones of countless fallen
It appears long abandoned and as still as the grave; yet, on rare
nights of occult significance, eldritch lights can be seen blazing
along its battlements, casting eerie shadows across the pass, even
in the blackest of nights On such nights, the Helspire reveals
itself as a citadel of the unquiet dead, and skeletal knights charge
forth, scouring the mountainside, terrorising both Reiklanders
and Bretonnian alike Little is known about the castle, and
none living claim to have pierced its bleak walls or know who
commands the legions of the undead that lurk therein Some say
a cabal of necromancers call it home, others whisper it is the vault
of a vampire, and a few even murmur the fortress is commanded
by a powerful Liche, in life a powerful sorcerer, clinging to
undeath in the pursuit of bloody vengeance for some centuriesold
slight Perhaps because of this uncertainty, the Helspire is
said to be filled with riches looted from across the Old World,
but none know the truth, as those who seek such treasures never
return or never talk
The Lorlay
Possessing a breathtaking vista, the Lorlay is an imposing
rock formation standing proud in the centre of the Reik some
40 miles downstream of Grissenwald The channels on either
side of the jutting island flow swift and deep, and despite the
relative narrowness of the river at this point, no crossing has been
successfully constructed
Romantic legends abound of a beautiful, elven maiden, pale of
skin and supple of limb, who swims in the fast-moving waters
at dawn and dusk Because of this, the Lorlay is popular spot for
affluent Reiklanders’ to hold Taalite stag parties before marriage,
and a surprising number of high-class inns can be found nearby
Tales of the singing water maiden are especially rife amongst
the Reikland’s river-bound sailors, and if their stories are to be
believed, she has been spotted by half the seamen of the navy
The Singing Stones
West of Schädelheim, deep in a wooded valley, stands an ancient
dolmen Its stones are old beyond reckoning, arrayed in a
spiralling pattern around a central arrangement of huge pillars
capped with an enormous slab, resembling nothing more than a
titanic altar From the ground it is nigh on impossible to discern
the intricate pattern of the stones, especially given the trees and
bushes that have grown in amongst the menhirs
When a westerly wind blows up the valley, in from the Wasteland,
the stones produce an eerie keening that echoes for miles around
While some locals claim listening to the stones’ song can give
insight into problems or grant strange wisdom, others declare
such nonsense is heresy, knowing nothing but trouble comes from
trafficking in such ungodly power, and are more than willing to
use violence to save the souls of the foolish

‘After sixty years in the trade, here are the three most important lessons
I’ve learned One: friendship means nothing Two: without ambition
you’re nothing Three: no matter how fruitless the prospect, you can
always squeeze more blood from a stone’
— Ubel Rikard-Goellner, Merchant Prince
The trappings you receive from your Class and Career (see
Chapter 2: Character) are enough to get you started, but you
may want more equipment During character creation, additional
items can be purchased from the lists in this chapter without
restriction However, once you start to play, the availability of
some trappings is limited, so make sure you buy everything you
want and can afford before you begin play

Money
Before you can buy new trappings, you first need to understand
how money works in the Empire
The Empire’s coins are most commonly minted in 3
denominations: Brass Pennies (d), Silver Shillings (/), and Gold
Crowns (GC) Coins usually weigh around an ounce and, as their
inherent value is determined by weight, even foreign coins can
be easily valued with a set of scales, though will likely draw a
suspicious eye
Standard coin values are:
1 gold crown (1GC) = 20 silver shillings (20/–) = 240
brass pennies (240d)
1 silver shilling (1/–) = 12 brass pennies (12d)
This is usually abbreviated to:
1 GC = 20/– = 240d
Money, Money, Money
For those new to WFRP, remembering there are 12 pennies
in a shilling and 20 shillings in 1 crown, for a total of 240
pennies to 1 crown, can take some getting used to, especially
if the money is mixed up a little, such as this: 6/8, or
6 shillings and 8 pence That number may initially look
arbitrary, but if you translate it to pennies, it becomes a
far more understandable 80d, or one third of a gold crown
Indeed, an 80d coin is fairly common in the Empire, and is
called a noble
Don’t worry too much about fully understanding the coins to
begin with An easy way to keep everything right in your head
is to translate all prices to pennies and think of it in your
local currency to get a grip of the numbers So, if British,
you could think of a brass penny as £1, a silver coin as worth
around £12, and a crown as £240 It’s not accurate, but does
help keep the money understandable until you are used to it
So, if someone offered you a job for 10 shillings, think of it
as £120, which is a fair bit of money But if someone offered
you a job for 10GC, that’s a far more tempting £2400!

288
The Cost of Living
As they wander the Empire, adventurers likely fill their purses
with coins of all three denominations, perhaps poor one day,
unexpectedly rich the next However, outside adventuring, most
lives centre on a single coin type as determined by Social Status
(see page 49)
Those seeking to maintain their Status must also keep up
appearances After all, if you repeatedly appear as poorer than
you are, others will unsurprisingly think you’re poor In practice,
dressing and eating as expected, and using trappings that are
fitting for your station, is enough for most folks to simply accept
you at face value What this requires in practice is left up to the
GM to determine, using the following as a guide:
	 Brass Tier: The poorest members of society are unlikely
to see a gold coin in their lifetimes They live humble lives,
subsisting on plain foods and sleeping in shared rooms,
and have little appearances to maintain Indeed, peers are
more likely to call them out for having airs and graces for
spending too much on fine clothes and food than they are
likely to note spending too little
	 Silver Tier: The swelling middle-classes may use pennies
for ale and gold for major purchases, but shillings are their
standard currency They dine well, sleep in comfortable beds,
and wear good quality clothing
	 Gold Tier: The wealthiest elites rarely bother themselves
with pfennigs They eat luxury foods, sleep on satin sheets,
and always stand out from the crowd due to their expensive
garb and trappings
For GMs preferring hard numbers, spending around half your
Status every day is usually enough to maintain appearances,
though you may be living a little frugally So, if you have a Status
of Silver 4, spending at least 2 shillings per day will do for food
and board, where if you have Brass 2 Status, you need only spend
a pfennig a day
Money Slang
Various slang terms are used for coins across the Empire
Here are some of the more common terms
	 Gold Crowns: Marks, Karls, Gelt
	 Silver Shillings: Bob, Shimmies, Mucks
	 Brass Pennies: Pfennigs, Clanks, Shrapnel
Criminal Coinage
Of course, if there is money involved there will be folk looking to
take any advantage they can, including criminal options For the
Rogues in your party, two schemes concerning coins are worth
knowing
Counterfeiting
The diversity of coinage circulating the Empire means
counterfeiting is rife Reiklanders may be accustomed to seeing
coins from other provinces, but are always wary of being scammed
A successful Evaluate Test will detect counterfeit coins, typically
by inspecting coins for weight and hardness
Actually producing counterfeit coins is much harder It requires
an Art (Engraving) Test to carve a convincing stamping die, then
a Trade (Blacksmith) Test to strike the coins, usually with the
aid of an assistant Including a higher precious metal content
makes Evaluate Tests to detect counterfeits more difficult; using
less than a fifth makes it much easier to spot the fake coins
Clipping
Embezzlers can trim slivers of precious metal away from the
edges of coins This scam is called ‘clipping’ or ‘shaving’ and is
practised mainly by shopkeepers or tollkeepers who have access
to large quantities of other peoples’ money Gold and silver filings
are then melted down and sold to jewellers, counterfeiters, or
fences Clipped coins can be detected with the Evaluate Skill; the
more of the coin that’s clipped, the easier the Test
The Nuln Standard
Altdorf may be the current capital of Reikland and the
Empire, but coinage standards are established in the city-state
of Nuln to the south Historically, Nuln was the Empire’s
capital until House Holswig-Schliestein restored the throne to
Altdorf a century ago, and many imperial institutions still call
that city home The Nuln Standard only governs coin weight
and metallurgy, not stamp imagery, which varies significantly
across the provinces

Once you start play, the availability of rarer goods is restricted
After all, it’s hard to find a harpsichord in a five-house hamlet,
but not so hard in the shops and markets of imperial capital,
Altdorf
The following rules for buying and selling are all optional The
GM may prefer to roleplay every visit to each market, hawker, or
shop, meaning Tests for Availability are unrequired as the GM
simply states what is or isn’t purchasable Equally, the GM may
prefer you to simply check the trapping lists, roll for Availability
and, if the Test succeeds, spend the coin on whatever you want
Possibly without even Haggling!
Opti
ons:
Tracking M
oney
Where some groups like to track every penny closely, perhaps
even using chits or fantasy coins to represent in-game coins,
others prefer to ignore all fiscal book-keeping The game
rules assume you are counting every coin, but if you wish to
simplify money, you can do so using your Status If an item
costs less than your
Status level — so if you have a
Status of
Silver 2, any item costing 2 silver shillings or less — you are
assumed to be able to buy as much as needed of that item
Beyond that, you can buy a maximum of one item a day that
costs more with a Haggle Test, with the difficulty set by the
GM according to the cost of the item and the local markets
Availability
All Trappings have an Availability, either Common, Scarce, Rare,
or Exotic
Common items are found in almost every corner of the Empire
and are always assumed to be readily available
Scarce and Rare items are less common, and you need to pass an
Availability Test to find any locally in stock; the chance of passing
the Test depends upon the settlement size
Exotic items are super rare, and only available if the GM says
so, or if you commission the item from an appropriate artisan
(perhaps with a Commission Endeavour, see page 197), or make
it yourself (perhaps with a Crafting Endeavour see page 197)
Once you know an item’s Availability, check it on the following
table to see if it is in stock
Village Town City
Common In Stock! In Stock! In Stock!
Scarce 30% 60% 90%
Rare 15% 30% 45%
Exotic Not in
Stock
Not in
Stock
Not in
Stock
If you fail an Availability Test for Scarce or Rare items, you can
either reroll when you arrive at a new settlement or you can try
again next week if the settlement is Town-size or larger
If an item is in stock, it’s up to the GM to determine how many
are available As a general rule-of-thumb, villages have a single
item in stock, towns have 1d10 items, and cities have as many
XI
as the GM deems appropriate These quantities are generally
doubled for Common items, and halved for Rare ones (rounding
up)
Bargaining and Trading
People of the Empire love a good bargain, and crowds of eager
shoppers fill town squares every day looking for the best deals
When buying goods, there are two primary Skills to Test:
Evaluate and Haggle
Evaluate is used by consumers to identify the quality of an item
(see Craftsmanship below) Similarly, the vendor can use Evaluate
to appraise coins for their exchange value, or spot counterfeits
Anyone can also use Evaluate to estimate the prices of Rare or
Exotic items to within +/-10%
Haggle is used routinely by consumers and vendors alike,
typically with Opposed Tests Haggling is expected and most
prices are marked up slightly to account for this Winning a
Haggle Test reduces the price by 10% (or possibly up to 20%
with an Astounding Success (6+) or with the Dealmaker Talent)
Failing a Haggle contest badly usually means the vendor distrusts
your coinage
Roleplaying Shopping Trips
Trips to the market for routine purchases don’t need to be
roleplayed in detail The GM might prefer you browse the
equipment lists and check for Availability yourself Major
purchases that involve item Craftsmanship, or require extra
Haggling, can be fun to roleplay in-character In certain scenarios,
shopkeepers are important NPCs with distinct personalities or
story roles, so it’s always worth interacting with them Consider
the following when roleplaying shopping:
	 The GM may overrule Availability as dictated by local
details For example, basic rowboats are automatically
available if the adventure is located in a fishing village that
features a renowned boat-builder
	 Availability percentages can be increased by +10% or +20%
if a character is especially diligent, belongs to a relevant
career such as Merchant or Fence, or spends an entire day
shopping and making Gossip Tests
Selling
Selling your trappings during desperate times, or simply
offloading loot, is handled in exactly the same fashion as Buying,
but this time you’ll be making money, not spending it So, you
first check for Availability of a buyer in the same fashion as
checking for stock You then bargain and trade, with Evaluate
Tests and Haggle Tests as the GM prefers, and finally you set a
price Typically, the base cost when selling is half the item’s listed
price, meaning, when selling second-hand, you usually make
between a quarter to half an item’s worth after Haggling
If you have a Career like fence or merchant, and you put time
into Gossip Tests and wandering the local town, you might
find someone willing to pay up to 80% of the item’s listed value,
though that is left in the hands of the GM
Lowering the Price
If you can’t find a buyer, you can try lowering the price Each time
you half the money you are willing to accept, the Availability of a
buyer increases by one step
Example: Corporal Mauser has fled his State Army regiment
with a Hochland Longrifle he stole, and is keen to sell As it’s an
Exotic item, there are no immediate buyers he can find on the
street The GM determines the base price Mauser can expect is
half the weapon’s value (so 50GC, half of the 100GC it’s worth),
so Mauser decides to drop the price by half two times, saying
he will accept 12GC 10/–, which increases the Availability of a
Buyer two steps from Exotic to Scarce
Bartering
Rural and mercantile commerce often involves trading one
commodity for another without exchanging money To resolve
bartering of this type, compare the Availability of the items being
traded against those being acquired The barter ratio indicates
how many ‘units’ must be traded, and how many ‘units’ of the
other commodity are acquired ‘Units’ are defined by checking
the equipment list prices of both items and grouping them into
packages of roughly equivalent value
Bartering Ratios
Traded
Items
Acquired Items
Common Scarce Rare Exotic
Common 1:1 2:1 4:1 8:1
Scarce 1:2 1:1 2:1 4:1
Rare 1:4 1:2 1:1 2:1
Exotic 1:8 1:4 1:2 1:1
Craftsmanship
The items available in the shops, stalls, and merchant halls of the
Empire vary significantly in quality Not everything is made equal,
and the Craftsmanship rules reflect this using Item Qualities, and
Item Flaws
An Item Quality makes the trapping a little better, but harder to
find An Item Flaw makes the trapping a little worse, but easier
to find
XI

the consumers’ guide
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
Item Qualities
A Trapping is called a Quality Trapping if it has more Item
Qualities than Flaws For each Item Quality the Trapping has,
double its price and make it one step less available
Example: A spade that has the Fine and Durable Item Qualities
costs quadruple the list price, and drops availability from
Common to Rare
Durable
Laboriously crafted using strong materials, the item can take
+Durable Damage points before it suffers any negatives (see
Weapon Damage and Armour Damage on pages 296 and 299)
and gains a saving throw of 9+ on a 1d10 roll against instant
breakage from sources like Trap Blade (see page 298) This
Quality can be taken multiple times Each time it is taken, the
saving throw improves by 1 (eg From 9+ to 8+)
Example: Molli owns a high quality sword with Durable 3,
meaning it can take 3 Damage before suffering any negatives,
and has a saving throw of 6+ against breaking
Fine
Meticulously crafted to please the eye This Quality is a sign of
social status and can be taken multiple times The higher the
quality, the more impressive it seems
Lightweight
Cleverly crafted for ease of carrying Reduce Encumbrance
points by 1
Practical
Expertly crafted with utility in mind A failed test using this item
receives +1 SL If the item is a piece of armour, any penalties for
wearing it are reduced by one level (for example from -30 to -20)
Options: Crafting Guilds
Most Artisans in the Empire are members of guilds that
protect their rights and ensure appropriate standards of
craftsmanship If a town or city contains a crafting guild,
related goods of poor quality are rarely available
If the GM states you are shopping in a town with relevant
crafting guilds, each item Flaw reduces Availability instead of
increasing it Furthermore, the first Item Quality does not
reduce Availability Prices are still modified as per usual
Item Flaws
A Trapping is called a Flawed Trapping if it has more Item Flaws
than Qualities Each Flaw halves the listed price and improves
Availability by one step Many vendors sell flawed items, but
pretend they are anything but A successful Test with any
appropriate skill — such as Evaluate, or Melee for weapons, or
Trade for tools — will spot such underhanded activities
Note: Exotic items do not have their Availability modified by
being Flawed — they are always difficult to find, even shoddy
examples
Example: A suit of chainmail that is both Bulky and Unreliable
costs a quarter of the list price, and raises Availability from Rare
to Common
Ugly
Crafted without any aesthetic awareness whatsoever, Ugly items
attract negative attention, and related Fellowship Tests might
even suffer a –10 penalty
Shoddy
Hastily crafted by an amateur or fraudster The item breaks
when used in any failed Test rolling a double Similarly, Shoddy
armour breaks if any Critical Hit is sustained to a Hit Location
it protects
XI
292
Unreliable
Crafted without attention to functionality, a failed test using this
item receives –1 SL Further, penalties for wearing Unreliable
armour are doubled
Bulky
An awkward design crafted clumsily Increase Encumbrance by
+1 (small trinkets cannot normally have this flaw) Bulky clothing
and armour are Enc 1 even when worn, and Fatigue penalties for
armour are doubled
Encumbrance
Even the doughtiest Dwarf cannot carry a limitless number
of trappings To help you track how much you are carrying, all
items are marked as weighing a number of Encumbrance points
(sometimes abbreviated to ‘Enc’), typically from 0–3, where
0 shows a trifling item that’s easily carried, and 3 represents
something that’s a struggle to heftThe number of Encumbrance
points you can carry without penalty is determined by your
Strength Bonus + Toughness Bonus Thus, average humans begin
play able to carry around 6 Encumbrance points
Encumbrance Examples
Enc Example Trappings
0 Knives, Coins, Jewelry
1 Sword, Mandolin, Sling Bag
2 Greatsword, Tent, Backpack
3 Halberd, Cask, Large Sack
Small Items
Common sense usually dictates the number of smaller items
someone can carry before becoming Encumbered To provide a
rough guide, money weighs 1 Encumbrance point per 200 coins
Over-sized Items
Certain large items weigh 4 or more Encumbrance points, such as
barrels or saddlebags You may normally only carry one oversized
object, and it likely requires both hands
Beasts of Burden
Draft animals ignore the standard Strength Bonus + Toughness
Bonus formula for Encumbrance points Encumbrance points for
mules, horses, carts and wagons are listed in their descriptions
Each Human-sized passenger is assumed to weigh around 10
Encumbrance points, modified by the GM as necessary
Worn Items
Worn items such as armour, clothing, and jewellery all have their
Encumbrance dropped by 1, which often means they count as
Encumbrance 0 when worn
Overburdened
Characters who exceed their Encumbrance capacity may be
slowed, and will become fatigued by travel Movement reduction
and Travel Fatigue incurred from Encumbrance stacks with any
Armour penalties Further, whenever you have to take a Fatigued
Condition when Overburdened for a reason other than being
Overburdened, gain an extra +1
Enc Penalty
Up to limit No penalties
Up to double
limit
–1 Movement (min: 3), –10 Agility,
+1 Travel Fatigue
Up to triple
limit
–2 Movement (min: 2), –20 Agility
(min: 10), +2 Travel Fatigue
More than 3× You’re not moving
Encumbrance and Attributes
Movement penalties for Encumbrance are applied immediately
and can only be removed by dropping equipment
Encumbrance and Travel Fatigue
Fatigued Conditions are accrued at the end of a day’s travel and
can only be removed with a long rest
Weapons
Weapons used across the Empire vary according to provincial
preference, religious requirement, individual inclination, and
trusty old tradition Here you will find a selection of the most
commonly wielded melee and ranged weapons, which are
presented using the following format
	 Weapon Group: Each Weapon is listed by its Weapon
Group If a weapon is two-handed, it is marked (2H)
	 Price: The price for an average example of the weapon
	 Enc: The Encumbrance for the weapon
	 Availability: The Availability of the weapon
	 Reach/Range: The Weapon’s length, or the range of the
weapon in yards
	 Damage: The weapon’s Damage, which is added to your
SL to hit
	 Qualities and Flaws: Any Weapon Qualities or Flaws the
weapon possesses
Strength Bonus is abbreviated to SB in the weapon tables

Hand Weapons
‘Hand Weapon’ is used to describe any of a number of basic
weapons that, though different, are assumed to be effectively
the same in-game, including swords, axes, hammers, maces,
short spears, and more
Blackpowder Ammunition
Blunderbusses are the only weapons listed that use the Small
Shot or Improvised Shot ammunition All other Blackpowder
and Engineering weapons use bullets
Weapon Damage
Some Fumble results (see page 160) or spells may damage your
weapon For each point of damage your weapon receives, reduce
its Damage by –1 If the Damage is reduced to +0 (or SB +0), the
weapon is mangled beyond all recognition, and now counts as an
Improvised Weapon If an Improvised Weapon is Damaged, it is
considered useless for melee combat
Weapons can be fixed by appropriate Artisans for 10% of the
weapon’s cost per damage point sustained Weapons reduced to
Improvised Weapons cannot be fixed You can also repair your
own weapons if you have the appropriate Trade Skill, Trade Tools
and, for more than a single point of Damage, a Workshop
Melee Weapon Groups
All melee weapons are assigned to a Weapon Group Each
Weapon Group requires a separate skill to master its use So,
Melee (Flail) allows you to use Flails and is a separate skill from
Melee (Polearm), which allows you to use Polearms If you use
a weapon from a Group where you have no Advances, you Test
your Weapon Skill to hit with the weapon While you still suffer
all the weapon’s Flaws, you cannot use any of its Qualities Some
Melee Weapon Groups also have special rules
Cavalry
Cavalry weapons are assumed to be used when mounted When
not used from horse-back, all two-handed weapons in the Cavalry
Weapon Group also count as Two-Handed weapons Singlehanded
Cavalry weapons are not normally used when unmounted
Flail
Unskilled characters add the Dangerous Weapon Flaw to their
Flails, and the other listed Weapon Qualities are not used
Parry
Any one-handed weapon with the Defensive Quality can be used
with Melee (Parry) When using Melee (Parry), a weapon can be

Weapon Reach
The lengths of the weapons are progressively bigger as follows
	 Personal: Your legs and fists, perhaps your head, and
anything attached to those
	 Very Short: Less than a foot in length
	 Short: Up to 2 feet in length
	 Average: Up to 3 feet long
	 Long: Up to 6 foot long
	 Very Long: Up to 10 feet in length; can Engage enemies
up to 4 yards away, rather than just 2
	 Massive: Anything over 10 feet long; can Engage enemies
up to 6 yards away, rather than just 2
Options: Weapon Length
and in-fighting
These are simple rules for those who like to use Weapon
length for more than simple description of appearance, and a
possible impediment to fitting down dark tunnels
Weapon Length
If your weapon is longer than your opponents’, they suffer a
penalty of –10 to hit you as you find it easier to keep them
at bay
In-Fighting
As your Action, you can perform an Opposed Melee Test to
attempt to step inside your opponent’s weapon length The
winner chooses if combat continues as normal or as ‘infighting’
During in-fighting, any weapon longer than Short
counts as an Improvised weapon
Ranged Weapon Groups
Ranged weapons are difficult to master You cannot attempt a
Ranged Test for a weapon you do not have the correct speciality
for So, if you know Ranged (Blackpowder), you cannot attempt a
Ranged (Bow) Test However, there are a few exceptions
Blackpowder and Explosives
Those with Ranged (Engineering) can use Blackpowder and
Explosive weapons without penalty
Crossbows andThrowing
Crossbows and Thrown weapons are relatively simple to use
You can attempt a Ranged (Crossbow) or Ranged (Throwing)
Test using your Ballistic Skill, but the weapon loses all Qualities
whilst retaining its Flaws
Engineering
All Engineering weapons can be used by characters with Ranged
(Blackpowder), but the weapons lose all Weapon Qualities whilst
retaining their flaws
Weapon Range
A weapon’s range is its medium range in yards Chapter 5: Rules
presents modifiers if a weapon is at Point Blank, Short, Long, or
Extreme range Calculate ranges as follows:
Calculating Range Bands
Point Blank = Range ÷ 10
Short = Range ÷ 2
Long = Range x 2
Extreme = Range x 3
Sample Weapon Ranges
Weapon Point
Blank Short Med Long Extreme
Bow 5 25 50 100 150
Heavy
Crossbow 10 50 100 200 300
Pistol 2 10 20 40 60
Sling 6 30 60 120 180
Weapon Qualities
Some weapons have specific advantages over others, which are
described with Weapon Qualities
Accurate
The weapon is accurate and easy to hit with Gain a bonus of +10
to any Test when firing this weapon
Blackpowder
The crack of gunfire followed by gouts of smoke and confusion
can be terrifying If you are targeted by a Blackpowder weapon,
you must pass an Average (+20) Cool Test or take a Broken
Condition, even if the shot misses
Blast (Rating)
All Characters within (Rating) yards of the struck target point
take SL+Weapon Damage, and suffer any Conditions the
weapon inflicts
Damaging
A Damaging weapon can use the higher score from either the
units die or the SL to determine the Damage caused from a
successful hit For example, if you roll 34 in your attack Test
XI
297
the consumers’ guide
Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay
and the target number was 52 you can choose to use the SL,
which in this case is 2, or the units die result, which is 4 An
Undamaging weapon can never also be Damaging (Undamaging
takes precedent)
Defensive
Defensive weapons are designed to parry incoming attacks If you
are wielding such a weapon, gain a bonus of +1 SL to any Melee
Test when you oppose an incoming attack
Distract
Distracting weapons can be used to drive an opponent back due to
their dangerous or whip-like natures Instead of causing Damage, a
successful attack with a Distracting weapon can force an opponent
back 1 yard per SL by which you win the Opposed Test
Entangle
Your weapon wraps around your opponents, entangling
them Any opponent successfully hit by your weapon gains
the Entangled Condition with a Strength value equal to your
Strength Characteristic When Entangling an opponent,
you cannot otherwise use the weapon to hit You can end the
Entangling whenever you wish
Fast
Fast weapons are designed to strike out with such speed that
parrying is not an option, leaving an opponent skewered before
they can react A wielder of a Fast weapon can choose to attack
with the Fast weapon outside of the normal Initiative sequence,
either striking first, last, or somewhere in between as desired
Further, all Melee Tests to defend against Fast weapons suffer a
penalty of –10 if your opponent is using a weapon without the
Fast Quality; other Skills defend as normal Two opponents with
Fast weapons fight in Initiative order (relative to each other)
as normal A Fast weapon may never also be Slow (Slow takes
precedent)
Hack
Hacking weapons have heavy blades that can hack through
armour with horrific ease If you hit an opponent, you Damage a
struck piece of armour or shield by 1 point as well as wounding
the target
Impact
Some weapons are just huge or cause terrible damage due to their
weight or design On a successful hit, add the result of the units
die of the attack roll to any Damage caused by an Impact weapon
An Undamaging weapon can never also have Impact
(Undamaging takes precedent)
Impale
Impale weapons can kill with a single clean blow Impale weapons
cause a Critical Hit on any number divisible by 10 (ie: 10, 20, 30,
etc) as well as on doubles (ie: 11, 22, 33) rolled equal or under
an appropriate Test in combat
If the impale comes from a ranged weapon, the ammunition used
has firmly lodged itself in the target’s body Arrows and bolts
require a successful Challenging (+0) Heal Test to remove —
bullets require a surgeon (see the Surgery Talent in Chapter 4:
Skills and Talents) You cannot heal 1 of your Wounds for each
unremoved arrow or bullet
Penetrating
The weapon is highly effective at penetrating armour Non-metal
APs are ignored, and the first point of all other armour is ignored
Pistol
You can use this weapon to attack in Close Combat
Precise
The weapon is easy to get on target Gain a bonus of +1 SL to any
successful Test when attacking with this weapon
Pummel
Pummel weapons are especially good at battering foes into
submission If you score a Head hit with a Pummel weapon,
attempt an Opposed Strength/ Endurance test against the
struck opponent If you win the test, your opponent gains a
Stunned Condition
Repeater (Rating)
Your weapon holds (Rating) shots, automatically reloading after
each time you fire When you use all your shots, you must fully
reload the weapon using the normal rules
Shield (Rating)
If you use this weapon to oppose an incoming attack, you count
as having (Rating) Armour Points on all locations of your body
If your weapon has a Shield Rating of 2 or higher (so: Shield 2
or Shield 3), you may also Oppose incoming missile shots in your
Line of Sight
Trap Blade
Some weapons are designed to trap other weapons, and sometimes
even break them If you score a Critical when defending against
an attack from a bladed weapon you can choose to trap it instead
of causing a Critical Hit
If you choose to do this, enact an Opposed Strength Test,
adding your SL from the previous Melee Test If you succeed,
your opponent drops the blade as it is yanked free If you score
an Astounding Success, you not only disarm your opponent, but
the force of your maneuver breaks their blade unless it has the
Unbreakable quality If you fail the Test, your opponent frees the
blade and may fight on as normal
Unbreakable
The weapon is exquisitely well-made or constructed from an
especially strong material Under almost all circumstances, this
weapon will not break, corrode, or lose its edge
XI
298
Wrap
Wrap weapons typically have long chains with weights at the
end, making it very difficult to parry them effectively Melee Tests
opposing an attack from a Wrap weapon suffer a penalty of –1 SL,
as parried strikes wrap over the top of shields, or around blades
Weapon Flaws
Some weapons are just difficult to use, or simply dangerous, as
described with Weapon Flaws
Dangerous
Some weapons are almost as likely to hurt you as your opponent
Any failed test including an 9 on either 10s or units die results in
a Fumble (see Chapter 5: Rules for more on Fumbles)
Imprecise
Imprecise weapons are difficult to bring to bear as they are
unwieldy or hard to aim Suffer a penalty of –1 SL when using
the weapon to attack An Imprecise Weapon can never be Precise
(Imprecise takes precedent)
Reload (Rating)
The weapon is slow to reload An unloaded weapon with this flaw
requires an Extended Ranged Test for the appropriate Weapon
Group scoring (Rating) SL to reload If you are interrupted while
reloading, you must start again from scratch
Slow
Slow weapons are unwieldy and heavy, making them difficult to
use properly Characters using Slow weapons always strike last in
a Round, regardless of Initiative order Further, opponents gain a
bonus of +1 SL to any Test to defend against your attacks
Tiring
The weapon is fatiguing to use or difficult to bring to bear You
only gain the benefit of the Impact and Damaging Weapon Traits
on a Turn you Charge
Undamaging
Some weapons are not very good at penetrating armour All APs
are doubled against Undamaging weapons Further, you do not
automatically inflict a minimum of 1 Wound on a successful hit
in combat
Armour
First off, avoid all contact That’s yer basic principle And in case you
can’t, always wear protection … What?’
– Corporal ‘Nobbs’ Nobbilar, Basic Combat Instructor
Armour is listed in the following format:
	 Armour Type: Each armour is listed by the material its
constructed from, in order of protective effectiveness
	 Price: The price to buy an average piece of the armour
	 Enc: The Encumbrance for the armour
	 Availability: The Availability of the armour
	 Penalty: Any penalty for wearing that specific piece of
Armour in addition to Encumbrance (Page 293) Note:
Some armour brings a penalty if you wear any of it, such as
wearing any chain brings a penalty of –10 Stealth
	 Locations: The Hit Locations the Armour protects
	 APs: The number of Armour Points the armour provides
to the protected Hit Locations
	 Qualities and Flaws: Any Armour Qualities or Flaws the
armour may possess
Armour Damage
As blows rains down on your armour, it can be damaged, possibly
permanently Whenever you are instructed to damage a piece of
armour, the APs in the location damaged are reduced by 1
If this lowers the APs to 0 in that location, the armour there is
rendered useless
Armour is generally damaged in one of two ways:
1 A special ability triggers, such as a spell or Talent,
damaging a piece of armour
2 A Critical Wound is deflected
Critical Deflection
This only occurs should you choose it to If you suffer a Critical
Wound from an incoming attack on a location protected by
armour, you can choose to let your armour be damaged by 1AP in
order to ignore the Critical Wound
You still suffer all normal Wounds (and given your APs are now
1 point lower, you probably suffer an extra Wound), but you avoid
the Critical Wound effects as the blow is absorbed by your nowdamaged
armour

Repairing Armour
It costs 10% of the armour’s base price per AP lost to repair it
So, if you had a Sleeved Chainmail Coat with 1AP of damage on
the Body, and 1AP of damage on the Arms, it will cost you 20%
of your armour’s base cost to fix it, in this case 12/– If a section
of your armour is completely broken, it will cost you 30% of the
armour’s base cost to fix, and you’ll likely be waiting some time
before it’s completed
You can also repair your own armour if you have the appropriate
Trade Skill, Trade Tools and, for Plate Armour, a Workshop
Armour Qualities
Armour can possess the following Armour Qualities:
Flexible
Flexible armour can be worn under a layer of non-Flexible
armour if you wish If you do so, you gain the benefit of both
Impenetrable
The armour is especially resilient, meaning most attacks simply
cannot penetrate it All Critical Wounds caused by an odd
number to hit you, such as 11 or 33, are ignored
Armour Flaws
Some armours have points of weakness, as described by Armour
Flaws
Partial
The armour does not cover the entire hit location An opponent
that rolls an even number to hit, or rolls a Critical Hit, ignores
the partial armour’s APs
Weakpoints
The armour has small weakpoints where a blade can slip in if your
opponent is sufficiently skilled or lucky If your opponent has a
weapon with the Impale Quality and scores a Critical, the APs of
your armour are ignored

Packs and Containers
Trappings can be packed into backpacks, sacks, and pouches,
making them easier to carry The table shows the Encumbrance
value for carrying a pack or other container (Enc), and the
number of Encumbrance the container can carry (Carries)
You only count the Enc value to determine the number of

Clothing and
Accessories
Clothing styles in the Empire vary considerably As a general
guideline, commoners wear simple tunics with breeches or
gowns Middle-class citizens favour puff-and-slash fashions
with hats and hosiery or dresses The elites flaunt capes, furs, and
flamboyant hats with extravagantly enormous feathers – the more

Courtly Garb: Nobles’ garb features embellishments such as lace
cuffs & collars, excessive high-quality fabric and pointed shoes
Servants also wear courtly garb to banquets and ceremonies,
although their surcoats and corsets are less ostentatious than the
nobles’ fashions and can therefore be purchased at half price
Hat: Fine quality hats are status symbols in the Empire’s towns
and cities The more flamboyant the hat, the better
Jewellery: Prices vary by craftsmanship, metal type, and gem
value As a general guideline, common rings without any
gemstones cost 10 coins equal to their metal type (ie brass, silver
or gold) whereas necklaces cost 20 coins of the same metal type
Sceptre: The highest-ranking legal officials carry sceptres to
indicate their status
Signet Ring: Gold rings with engraved stamps are worn by
nobles and guild officials, who use them to imprint heraldry or
insignia into sealing wax
Walking Cane: Polished wooden canes with metal caps are status
symbols amongst wealthier townsfolk
Food, Drink, and Lodging

Books and Documents
The printing press is a recent invention in the Empire, so most
books are still hand-written, some with pages adorned with
exquisite illuminations, others little better than scribbled notes
In larger settlements, official documents, newssheets, and leaflets
are typically press-printed, as are many poems, romances, and
important academic texts All prices are loose suggestions only, as

A basic apothecary book contains ingredient descriptions and
diagrammed instructions for brewing processes Formulas for
Digestive Tonics, Healing Draughts, and Vitality Draughts
are usually included (see Herbs & Draughts) Advanced texts
contain formulas for more exotic draughts
Book, Art: Plays, poems, and ballads or perhaps musical
arrangements scribbled on loose parchment, Art books come in
many forms They also include treatises on perspective, form, and
style, often written by famous painters or sculptors — such as
Leonardo da Miragliano — for mass printing
Book, Cryptography: Where individual ciphers and encryption
keys can be written on a single page or two, Cryptography
books are often hand-scribed codices dealing with mathematics,
numerology, and polyalphabetic encryption
Book, Engineer: The majority of engineering books are pressprinted
Engineering is an advanced science in the Empire,
largely due to the Imperial Engineers’ School in Altdorf and the
Dwarf Engineers’ Guild Because of this, Engineering texts are
often authored, co-authored, or edited by Dwarfs
Book, Law: Laws vary considerably from one region to the next
Cities with printing presses compile legislation in bound volumes,
whereas judges in smaller towns often rely on documents handwritten
centuries ago Law books used by travelling lawyers or
judges often combine printed and written pages from different
towns across the Empire, collated and bound together within the
same cover
Book, Magic: Spell grimoires are usually scribed by wizards, and
their covers are often secured with locks Sometimes grimoires
are even protected by magical alarms or wards Carrying a spell
grimoire is punishable as heresy unless the owning wizard is
licensed by the Colleges of Magic
Book, Medicine: Medical texts can either be scribed or pressprinted,
depending on the authoring physician’s prestige
Illuminations are common, and usually include detailed autopsy
drawings and procedural diagrams

Book, Religion: Religions books come in all forms in the
Empire, a realm renowned for its religious observances There
is a eager market for the most popular texts, most of which are

Guild License: Guild licenses are usually printed on single sheets
of parchment, stamped with an official seal, and signed by the
local guild master Guild licenses are not purchased; instead, they
are granted to guild members according to each guild’s traditions
and laws
Legal Document: A simple legal document such as a will, IOU
or letter of intent
Options: Guilders
If you have an appropriate guild license, you can use your
special contacts to locate rare items If you fail an Availability
Test when trying to buy an item, you can make a Gossip Test
to talk with your fellow Guilders and see if any of them know
where you might find what you need If you succeed, one of

Drugs and Poisons
Recreational drugs, although not illegal in most parts of the
Empire, are frequently associated with dubious rituals and cults
by the Cult of Sigmar Attitudes are more liberal in large cities
where dens can be found offering spit, weirdroot, or Ranald’s
Delight Poison is not illegal either, but owning poison is bound

Prosthetics
Whether through disease, warfare, or misfortune, it’s a relatively

Eye Patch: Often decorated, an eye patch is used to cover scarred
eye sockets
False Eye: Particularly popular amongst the rich who prefer not
to wear cruder eye-patches, false eyes come in many forms, from
wooden to polished glass
False Leg: A False Leg (or just a False Foot, for half price),
allows you to ignore 1 point of Movement loss due to the missing
body part Further, for 100 XP you can regain the last point of
Movement Loss as you train yourself to use your new body part,
and for 200 XP you relearn how to use Dodge again This all
requires you not to lose your False Leg, though
Gilded Nose: Though most are made of wood or ceramic, the
term gilded nose is widely used regardless You can ignore the
Fellowship loss for having no nose
Hook: You have a hook strapped where you used to have a hand
A surprisingly nimble tool once you are used to it, you can buy
back the –20 penalty on all Tests involving two hands for 100
XP per 5 you subtract from the penalty, removing the penalty
completely for 400 XP Append: In Close Combat, Hooks count
as Daggers
Engineering Marvel: Only for the exceedingly rich, you
commission a work of art from one of the Engineers’ Guilds,
allowing you to completely ignore the loss of an ear, hand, arm,
or leg, as steam hisses and machinery clicks in place of blood and
muscle Should you ever receive a Critical Wound to the marvel,
it automatically breaks down, and needs to be taken back for
costly repair (at least 10% of the base cost, depending upon the
nature of the Critical Wound received)
Wooden Teeth: False Teeth are often beautifully carved and
painted, and sometimes a significant improvement to the
originals You ignore all penalties for loss of teeth

Hirelings
If you need extra muscle or brains whilst adventuring, you may
pay Hireling NPCs to accompany you You can hire any Career
with GM permission, and they are paid an amount of coin equal
to their Social Status for a quick job, or paid triple for a full day’s
work The GM may increase or decrease this amount according
to individual personality and local circumstances
If the job at hand is unexpectedly dangerous, Hirelings will
expect double the normal pay unless a Leadership Test is
passed Leadership Tests may also be required when Hirelings are
assigned complex, independent tasks, or if they have good reason
to flee from an encounter Quick Hireling profiles are created by
adding 5 Advances to every Career Characteristic and Skill per
level of the Career hired, and 1 Talent per level Hirelings with
more experienced than this usually cost more

Henchmen
Henchmen are Hirelings, companions, friends, pets, or other
NPCs that are effectively permanent members of your party
Unlike other NPCs, Henchmen should have full character sheets,
just like a PC, and are typically attached to one player, either as an
employee, friend, owner, or similar The Henchmen earns half the
XP of that player, rounding down, which the player may spend
on the Henchman’s behalf Henchmen not only make memorable
allies, but should your character die, they can also make marvellous
PC replacements instead of creating a new character

‘Adversity with the monster makes the man Prosperity with the man
makes the monster’
– Albrecht Zweistein, Middenlander Professor
The creatures presented in the Bestiary are generic, typical starter
examples of their ilk You are encouraged to customise them and
create your own, using the statistics found here and adding Skills
and Talents as you feel are necessary, perhaps even using the
full Career system to create terrifying opponents The quickest
way to create fast NPC adversaries is to use Creature Traits; all
creatures come with one or more Creature Traits as standard, but
additional ones can be added as required, and they can be mixed
with Skills and Talents as you see fit
The Optional traits listed alongside each creature presents some
of the most commonly found variants of the species However,
you may choose to apply any trait to any creature if it fits what
you want to represent in your game
For Creature Trait rules, refer to page 338
Creature Hit Locations
At some point you may need to determine a Hit Location for
a non-Human-shaped creature Normally, this is simple For
quadrupeds, simply make arm hits foreleg hits, and leg hits
rear-leg hits Or for birds, make arm hits equate to wing hits
However, some require special attention, such as Snakes and
Spiders For those, use Alternative Hit Locations
For any creature 2 steps larger than you (see Size on page 341),
choose a location to hit according to what’s closest to you (or in
Line-of-Sight for shooting)
If an animal has a Hit Location without a Critical Table, such
as a tentacle, tail, or wing, roll on the Arm table and describe the
results in an appropriate way
Alternative Hit Locations
Snakes Spiders
01–19 Head 01–09 Head
20–00 Body 10–79 Legs

Afraid, Animosity, Armour, Big, Brute, Clever, Cunning, Elite, Fast,
Hardy, Hatred, Leader, Prejudice, Tough, Weapon
Note: Most creatures have a suggested Weapon included, and
maybe Armour too, but that doesn’t preclude them from being
changed as you see fit

Ogres
Big, loud, brutish, and extremely violent, Ogres are driven by the need to
fill their prodigious, muscled bellies They lack the wit or intelligence to
do this cleverly, defaulting to might is right in most situations Hailing
from lands far to the east, Ogres are a common sight in the Old World for
they love to wander, always on the hunt for new meats over the horizon
As they pass through on decades-long food excursions, they work hard
to integrate, wearing local clothing and following the local customs they
understand, as that’s more likely to attract the next meal
In the Empire, they frequently serve in the State Army, and are an
everyday sight in larger towns, contracted as muscle for hire The Halfling
Gaffers Guild (building contractors) has effectively cornered the market
in cheap Ogre labour in many towns and cities of the Empire, a source of
great annoyance to their rivals

‘Yes, I summoned them because I needed reinforcements Yes, I know they are eating your prize cattle And, yes, I know Ogres have large appetites ‘I‘ve

Halflings and Ogres
None know why, but Halflings and Ogres just get on Most elders of Halfling clans have one or two Ogre bodyguards, and it’s said
the Elder of the Moot rarely travels without his old friend Zorarth Legbiter, a hoary Ogre who’s lived in the Empire for almost a
century In return, many Ogre mercenary bands employ Halfling cooks However, this relationship doesn’t always hold, such as when
Golgfag Maneater, mercenary captain of the imaginatively named Golgfag’s Maneaters, famously employing a small clan of Halflings
to feed him and his regiment after a great victory Which was fine until Golgfag realised the cooks tasted far better than the food
they’d prepared…

Boars
Scavenging in the forest, Boars are reclusive creatures, but when cornered will fight using
their sharp tusks with a tenacity that shocks the unprepared Though most are 5–6 feet
long, some grow to remarkable proportions, with the largest prized by Orcs, who use them
as ferocious war mounts

Random Creatures and Custom PC species
The Bestiary presents Characteristics as a round number, such as 20, 25, or 30 Obviously, in practice, the numbers vary significantly
from individual to individual If you wish to randomly create Characteristics, subtract –10, then add 2d10 So, a Characteristic of
30 translates to 2d10+20 If a Characteristic starts at 5, roll just 1d10 to randomise it This can even be used to create PCs out of
traditionally NPC species by using random Characteristics and adding an appropriate career, creating, say, an Ogre soldier, Skaven
engineer, or Vampire noble Obviously, this will take a little bending of the rules to work, but if you are interested in playing characters
like this, it’s not difficult to do
Dogs
Dogs are bred for myriad purposes throughout the Old World While the pampered
pooches of the courtiers of Altdorf pose only a threat to an adventurer’s dignity, larger
breeds, including those bred for war and dogfighting can be a formidable threat

Giant Rats
Rats get everywhere and are especially prevalent in the cities and towns The more
densely people are packed in, the more densely Rats are packed in with them, which is
especially bad when the creatures carry disease Though typically small, they can grow
to monstrous proportions, with reports of rats beneath Altdorf the size of a Human
and larger Rat catchers are employed to keep them in check

Giant Spiders lurk deep within the forests and caves of the Empire, but can live anywhere,
including dusty attics and dark cellars Most trap their prey with strong webs before injecting
venom Though most are the size of a large Rat, some Giant Spider species are terrifyingly large
Forest Goblins often capture larger examples for mounts

Basilisks
These eight-legged reptilian creatures are solitary and elusive Claimed to be one of the most ancient creatures of Chaos, they are said to be
filled with such spite and venom the very ground they walk on is poisoned Their bite, too, is poisonous, but it’s their petrifying gaze most fear
Rarely encountered these days, basilisks are a most dangerous foe Their glands and organs are highly prized by wizards and alchemists, so

in perfect stillness, able to sense the vibrations of approaching creatures, then erupt from the
muddy water, seeking to grapple and drown using their strong tentacles Usually mottled green
and brown, Bog Octopuses are perfectly camouflaged for boggy environments, their huge,

by wizards skilled in Jade magic to act as a bodyguard or to fulfil a specific

independently, spawned in stagnant festering pools where the flow of magic

Fimir
Fimir are secretive, one-eyed, reptilian creatures that stalk the darkest recesses of the
dank swamps and boglands of western Reikland They shun sunlight, usually only
appearing at dawn or dusk, or under the cover of mist and fog to spirit away victims
for mysterious, loathsome purposes Human witches reckless or desperate enough to
meddle in the affairs of Daemons have been known to seek out the Fimir to learn
their malign mysteries, for it is said they summon and control such entities Whether
the greater risk lies in trafficking with the Ruinous Powers, or treating with the Fimir,
is anyone’s guess The Fimir have a matriarchal society The leader of each clan is a
powerful witch called a Meargh, and she’s aided by a cadre of lesser spellcasters called
Dirach The majority of the clan members are lowly Shearls, who are protected by a
warrior caste, the Fimm, who have bony spikes and knobs on their tails, used to break
the bones of unwary opponents

Giants are solitary creatures who usually shun civilisation Most stalk remote and
high places surrounding the Empire, holing-up in caves and forgotten ruins far from
smaller folk, though they sometimes migrate to the foothills in search of food They
have a reputation for belligerence and ferocity, due in equal parts to their intimidating
size, their cattle eating, and their association with marauding Greenskin armies that
enslave them In truth, many giants are gentle souls, prone to raging tantrums and
fiercely protective of their privacy, but not necessarily hostile to others Because they
are so long-lived, rumours suggest they hoard ancient lore, though most seem less than
lucid, and certainly more interested in alcohol than debates about history

Griffons
With the forequarters and wings of an eagle and the hindquarters of a great cat,
Griffons are elegant beasts with a naturally proud and regal bearing They nest high
in the mountains that surround the Empire and are swift, efficient killers, not prone
to the indiscriminate destruction of creatures like Manticores or Hippogryphs
Perhaps because of this seeming nobility, the image of the Griffon is extraordinarily
popular in the Empire, used on heraldry, religious iconography, and as a symbol of
the Empire itself Griffons are also one of the most intelligent of beasts If captured
relatively young and subject to correct training, they can be incredibly loyal, able to
anticipate and obey a wide variety of commands They are so highly sought after
that hunters regularly die trying to secure Griffon eggs to sell Perhaps the most
renowned Griffon in Reikland is Deathclaw Housed in the Imperial Zoo in
Altdorf, Deathclaw is personally owned by the Crown Prince of Reikland and
was reputedly hatched by Emperor Karl-Franz himself — a story that led to all
manner of lewd cartoons being printed in seditious pamphlets

wings, and front quarters of an eagle and the hind quarters of a horse Hailing
most commonly from the Grey Mountains, they attack without provocation,
almost reckless in their fury, tearing flesh into ribbons to be devoured later
Such is their rage, entire fields of livestock will be wiped out by a single
Hippogryph, which will then make off with its choice of meat, leaving the rest
to carrion birds Having little in the way of intelligence, when Hippogryphs
hunt, they tend to kill everything in sight, assuming anything unseen is gone
forever, meaning that actual casualties to Hippogryphs are relatively low, given
all it takes to avoid them is finding a good hiding place

the slightest wound Worse, any viewing this horror seem to lose their minds, gibbering and rhyming, clawing at their eyes, and shrieking
with manic laughter, which leaves easy prey for the Jabberslythe
Further, it has a sticky tongue that can lash out and pull its next meal into its gaping maw As befits its appearance, the creature moves in a

Trolls are filthy, foul creatures that infest all corners of the Old World Quick to
adapt to their surroundings they come in a variety of types, but all are huge and
imposing They are dim and led by their instinct for food, but they like to hoard and
their lairs can be a trove of useful and valuable treasures… and the grisly remains of
their meals Although there are many species of Troll, they all share some common
features: they are usually extremely stupid, which means any quick-witted foe can
get an edge over them; they can regenerate, which makes them extremely difficult to
kill; and they are able to regurgitate their last meal at will, vomiting acrid bile over
a shockingly impressive distance — although they are loathe to do this as it leaves
them extremely hungry

– Ignatius of Nuln, Man of Letters
Going for a Troll
There are a number of species of Trolls so you should feel free to customise them at will Some of the Trolls most likely to trouble
parties in the Reikland include:
Chaos Trolls: These bear one or more Mutations These ‘gifts’ from the Dark Gods of Chaos make them especially dangerous and
unpredictable These unfortunate creatures are often pressed into the service of marauding chaos warbands, or Beastman Warherds —
the more severely mutated the Troll, the greater the perceived favour of the Ruinous Powers, and the greater the value of the monster
to its herd
River Trolls: Skulking in the stagnant, foetid marshes of the Reik, River Trolls are an unfortunately common sight They are
opportunistic hunters, using their weed-like hides as they float like clumps of weed or flotsam, or lie in wait in muddy banks waiting
for small boats or unwary travellers
Stone Trolls: Rarely seen outside of the mountain ranges of the Empire, Stone Trolls have exceedingly tough hides that have ossified
into rough, stone-like armoured plates, which both protect the troll from damage and help them blend into their surroundings They
make their lairs in caves and are one of the most common hazards encountered by those crossing the Grey Mountains

Wyverns
Although the uneducated often mistake them for Dragons, beyond their superficial
similarities, foul-smelling Wyverns are nothing like those dignified creatures Cowardly
scavengers with weak eyesight, they tend to sate their rapacious appetites by picking
off defenceless creatures — mostly sheep and goats — avoiding outright combat when
possible Unlike other monsters of the Mountains, Wyverns are not especially territorial,
and tend to move on when their hunting grounds are invaded

The Greenskin Hordes
Orcs and Goblins are the scourge of civilisation They raid ceaselessly from their crude fortifications, most commonly warring amongst

and bind the neighbouring tribes under one banner Then the drums of war sound, and the green tide swells once more, ready to wash over
every village and town in its path, leaving nothing but blood and ruin in its wake
Orcs
Orcs are nasty, brutal, belligerent, and almost immune to pain They have muscular,
hulking bodies, wide, powerful shoulders, and won’t let a little thing like a lost arm get
in the way of a good scrap They are built for fighting and like nothing more than doing
so When they have no enemies to fight, they take on rival groups of Greenskins If there
is no rival group, they will fight among themselves Though not as numerous as Goblins,
they are bigger and tougher, and they let them know it at every opportunity Orcs can
grow to prodigious size, with larger Orcs stronger, tougher, and more aggressive, and
therefore accorded more prestige: for might equals right in their warlike society Some
Orcs ride huge boars into battle, a sight that rarely fails to terrify

Neither living, nor truly dead, the Undead are the animate corpses of once living beings, granted an unholy parody of life through the fell

Cairn Wraiths are especially potent spirits, the spectral remains of aspiring necromancers who sought
to prolong their existence through dark magic In life they were strong-willed; in death their malevolent
will drives them to exact a fearful vengeance on the burning souls of the living Many such Wraiths
haunt the mist-shrouded cairns that dot the landscape of the Empire, such as the fell Hägercrybs

Tomb Banshees are the spectral remains of once powerful witches whose spirits are steeped in
the foetid energy of dhar Their restless afterlife is tormented by loss and bitterness, a yawning
void in their souls that drives them to release terrifying, soul-wrenching howls potent enough
to drive those hearing it insane, or even to stop their very hearts

Vampires see themselves as the rulers of the night Many can pass as Human, some even functioning for long periods amongst the living
Despite their outwardly Human appearance, no heart beats beneath their pale skin, and in lieu of mortal hungers they possess an abiding thirst
for blood All Vampires of the Old World are ultimately descended from ancient bloodlines that originated millennia ago far to the south
Many are fiercely proud of their heritage and the traits and traditions that set them apart from others The Vampires of different bloodlines
are often bitter rivals, but they are astute enough to come together when necessary to face greater foes

Ghosts
Ghosts are the sprits of tormented souls who died with unfinished business
Much like Skeletons and Zombies, Ghosts may be summoned by Vampires or
Necromancers, or may haunt areas suffused with Dhar In exceptional circumstances,
particularly driven spirits may claw their way from the Realm of Morr in pursuit of
their own business, though such occurrences quickly draw the attention of the cult
of Morr, or the magisters of the Amethyst Order When summoned through the
necromantic arts, Ghosts swarm together, forming great Spirit Hosts that swoop and
plunge amongst their foes, spreading fear and disarray in their wake

Slaves to Darkness
Chaos The very word is enough to send superstitious smallfolk scurrying for the temple of Sigmar, making the sign of the hammer as they
flee But, for all good citizens of the Empire fear Chaos invasion or Beastmen attack, the true danger lies within the Empire’s borders; cultists
lurk in basements, corrupt nobles treat with Daemons, and ignorant villagers make offerings of their mutated offspring rather than killing
them swiftly, unwittingly swelling the ranks of armies of the damned
Beastmen, The Children of Chaos
Beastmen are grotesque hybrids of animal and Human They consider themselves the true children of Chaos, blessed by the Dark Gods before
all other species Their savage herds stalk the forests, gathering numbers and worshipping at profane altars of stone daubed with excrement
Gors
Gors, the most common Beastmen, haunt almost every forest of the Old World Their
appearance varies widely, but all combine bestial and Human traits, often with the
heads and legs of Goats with the torso and arms of Humans The only feature all Gor
universally possess is a large pair of horns — the larger the better, for they denote status
amongst Beastmen — a trait that distinguishes them from Ungor and Turnskins The
largest Gors are known as Bestigors

Ungors
Ungors have vestigial or very short horns and are thus barely considered ‘Gor’ by the rest of
the herd Some even sport Human-like faces, making them effective infiltrators, but also a
target for ridicule Indeed, Ungors are poorly treated by the Gors, and are often stunted or
malnourished in comparison to their larger-horned brethren, leaving them bitter creatures
eager to take out their jealousy on others

Bray-Shaman are born with the instinctive ability to wield the powers of Chaos, which they

to speak the will of the Dark Gods themselves

Cultists, The Lost and the Damned
Like a rotten beam beneath white-washed walls, a terrible enemy lurks unseen within the Empire In every province and town, men and
women are seduced by the subtle lures of Chaos, tempted by the promise of power, knowledge, strength, or release
Mutants
One of the most tragic fates to befall a Human is to succumb to the mutating influence of
Chaos It can happen without rhyme or reason, and even babies can be born mutated When
such happens, many parents find they cannot summon the will to murder their children, so
instead abandon their offspring to the woods, either to die or be taken in by other Mutants
or Beastmen No matter how innocent they may be, all mutants are a source of terror for the
common folk, so most fall to the Dark Gods, abandoned and embittered, or end it all before
it’s too late

Cultists
For those untainted by the blight of Chaos, it appears horrifyingly alien, but to those
it affects, every step towards damnation, every idea bringing them closer to Chaos,
seems not only logical, but inevitable Some especially devout followers of proscribed
cults are granted ‘gifts’ by their gods; foul mutations that will ensure their deaths
should the witch hunters unearth their secret

Heavily armoured hulking brutes adorned with ornate spikes and eye-watering symbols of their gods, Chaos Warriors are clearly no longer
Human Nothing is left of their former lives, they exist to serve their dark patron and nothing more While most Chaos Warriors are exalted
marauders from lands far to the north, a select few cultists may be gifted a prize of Chaos Armour by the Dark Gods, affording them great
power at the cost of never removing the armour for as long as they live As few warriors are their better, and no knight better protected, their
lives are often very long indeed

Daemons, The Gibbering Hosts
Daemons are blasphemous horrors from the Realms of Chaos, the unholy will of the Chaos Gods made manifest In the Reikland, Daemons
likely only appear if summoned by Cultists of the Ruinous Powers Though their presence is unlikely to last for long as the material realm
abhors their existence, the havoc they wreak is so profound that none who encounter Daemons ever forget the mind-fracturing experience
While most Daemons owe allegiance to one of the four Chaos Gods, some are simple beasts of the Aethyr, possessing no particular will of
their own, spilling forth into the Old World in a frenzy of mindless destructiveness whenever they can Only four samples of Daemons are
given here — two Lesser Daemons and two Daemon Princes — but any other Daemon you require can easily be built using Creature Traits

The Loat hsome Ratmen
Skaven are a malevolent species of ratmen living beneath everyone’s feet, watching, waiting, and impatient They eke out a foul existence in the
sewers and tunnels beneath the Empire’s cities and are so rarely seen that those who do usually dismiss them as mere Beastmen or Mutants
Few ever suspect the sinister truth: an Underempire exists right beneath their feet, its tunnels stretching between every city of the Old World
and beyond
Skaven society is built on the backs of slaves captured from across the Old World Supporting this, many shady Humans supply slaves and
warpstone in exchange for unsavoury favours and secret knowledge: for the Skaven spy network is vast and pervasive
Aware of the delicate position they inhabit, feasting on the subterranean entrails of other societies, the Skaven protect their secrets by any
means necessary Those foolish enough to talk openly of a complex civilisation of sentient ratmen beneath the Empire’s cobbled-streets may
find themselves dead in a gutter, an unfortunate victim of an unlikely accident
 ‘I never seen nothin’ There were no ratmen, you hear? Just bad luck Wilbur slipped and fell, that’s all He got careless, fell down a ladder onto his
own knife Ten times Just bad luck’

Clanrats
Most Skaven are Clanrats, hailing from one of the many complex Skaven clans that
constantly bicker, politic, backstab, and eventually war on each other They generally act
on the orders of higher-status Skaven, but are always looking for a way to secure a better
position, most often by betrayal They usually dress in mouldering leather or filthy cloth,
with scraps of rusty and tarnished metal serving as makeshift armour Clanrats are often
sent out as scouts or raiders to scavenge for goods, search for warpstone, or raid for slaves

it also fully regenerates a Critical Wound, losing all penalties and
Conditions associated with it Any Critical Wounds or Wounds
caused by Fire may not be regenerated and should be recorded
separately
Using Size
If you wish to use Size to make a creature bigger — for
example converting a Giant Spider to a Gigantic Spider —
then increase Strength and Toughness by +10 and reduce
Agility by –5 per step of size you increase the creature
Reverse this if you wish to make a creature smaller
Size (Various)
This trait represents creatures whose size differ from the game
standard (ie roughly human sized) There are seven steps of Size,
ranging from Tiny to Monstrous
Size Examples
Tiny Butterfly, Mouse, Pigeon
Little Cat, Hawk, Human Baby
Small Giant Rat, Halfling, Human Child
Average Dwarf, Elf, Human
Large Horse, Ogre, Troll
Enormous Griffon, Wyvern, Manticore
Monstrous Dragon, Giant, Greater Daemon
Size Combat Modifiers
If larger:
	 Its weapons gain the Damaging Quality if the creature is
one step larger, and Impact if two steps or more larger
	 It multiplies any Damage caused by the number of steps
larger it is (so, 2 steps=×2, 3 steps =×3, and so on); this
multiplication is calculated after all modifiers are applied
	 All successful strikes against smaller targets activate the
Deathblow rule, even if the target survives(see page 160)
If smaller:
	 It gains a bonus of +10 to hit
Defending Against Big Creatures
You suffer a penalty of –2 SL for each step larger your opponent is
when using Melee to defend an Opposed Test It is recommended
to dodge a Giant swinging a tree, not parry it!
Fear and Terror
If the creature is perceived to be aggressive, it causes Fear in any
creature smaller than it, and Terror in any creature two or more
steps smaller The rating of the Fear or Terror equals the Size step
difference So, if the creature is Large, and its opponent is Small,
it will cause Terror 2 See page 191
Moving in Combat
A creature that is larger ignores the need to Disengage if it wishes
to leave melee combat; instead, it brushes smaller combatants out
of the way, moving where it wishes
Opposed Strength
During Opposed Strength Tests (and similar), if one creature is
2 or more size steps larger, it wins automatically If one creature
is 1 size step larger, the smaller creature must roll a Critical to
contest the roll If it does, SL are compared as normal All other
results mean the larger creature wins
Stomp
Creatures that are larger than their opponents may make one
Stomp as a Free Attack, by spending 1 Advantage, as they kick
downwards or otherwise bash smaller opponents out of the way
This attack has a Damage equal to their Strength Bonus +0
Wounds
Larger creatures have more Wounds:
Size Wounds
Tiny 1
Little Toughness Bonus
Small (2×Toughness Bonus) + Willpower
Bonus
Average Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness Bonus)
+ Willpower Bonus
Large (Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness
Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×2
Enormous (Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness
Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×4
Monstrous (Strength Bonus+(2×Toughness
Bonus) + Willpower Bonus) ×8

opponent — see page 160) All opponents Engaged with a
Swarm automatically lose 1 Wound at the end of every Round as

+40 to hit

Tongue Attack Rating (Range)
The creature’s prehensile tongue can wrap itself around prey,

does Damage equal to its Rating (the range is in brackets) If the
attack hits, the target receives 1 Entangled Condition and, if a
smaller Size, is dragged towards the creature, and is Engaged in
melee combat The creature can then choose whether to release
the target, perform a Free Attack using its Weapon Trait, or to
keep the target wrapped in its tongue, initiating a Grapple (see
page 163)

other abilities affect Undead only
Unstable
The creature’s corpus is maintained by foul magics that are
inherently unstable in the material realm Whenever it ends
a round engaged with an opponent with higher Advantage,
the creature loses as many Wounds as the difference So, if the
creature had 1 Advantage, and its opponent had 3, the creature
would lose 2 Wounds If the creature ever reach 0 Wounds, the
magics holding it in place collapse, and it ‘dies’
Vampiric

against an appropriate opponent, it heals as many Wounds as its
opponent loses Drinking blood in this way is the only way it can
heal

its opponents in foul, semi-digested filth On its turn, by spending
3 Advantage, the creature can activate its Vomit as a Free Attack

yards and lets loose; all targets within two yards are also hit
The creature performs an Opposed Ballistic Skill/Dodge
Test against all affected targets (its single roll opposed by
each individual target) The Test is typically Easy (+40) for the
vomiting creature, due to the close range, and Challenging (+0)
for opponents All losing targets suffer a hit with a Weapon
Damage of the creature’s Toughness Bonus +4 and receive a
Stunned condition
All Armour and Weapons carried by affected targets suffer 1
Damage as the acidic vomit corrodes it away
Ward (Rating)

just plain lucky, some blows just seem to miss Roll 1d10 after any
blow is received, if the creature rolls Rating or higher, the blow is
ignored, even if it is a critical
Wallcrawler

traverse ceilings, ready to drop on unwary prey It moves at full
Movement across any appropriate surface and automatically
passes all Climb tests

Strength Bonus (representing a Hand Weapon)
